      "Doc:  A massacre at Mexican prison, then an escape Monday, February 20, 2012 14:32:00 GMT-05:00 MEXICO CITY ‚Äî The worst prison riot in Mexico in years was not really a riot. It was mass murder. Mexican officials said Monday that it appears all of the 44 inmates stabbed and beaten to death at a state prison in northern Mexico on Sunday were members of the same crime syndicate, known as the Gulf Cartel. They were murdered by their arch enemies, members of Los Zetas, a sensationally violent group that appears to have staged the massacre, in part, as a diversion. About 30 members of the Zeta cartel escaped from the overcrowded Apodaca prison near Monterrey in the hours after the killings. Officials called the escapees ‚Äúespecially dangerous.‚Äù What was initially characterized as a melee among rival gangs appears to have been a well-planned and -executed attack, followed by a successful getaway, accomplished with the help of the jailers. The governor of Nuevo Leon, Rodrigo Medina, told reporters Monday that the prison's director, three top officials and 18 guards are under investigation and may have aided in the escape. The governor called the prison officials ‚Äúa group of traitors‚Äù and said that it appeared they were corrupted by the powerful Zeta syndicate. ‚ÄúThe most important thing is to make sure that the people working on the inside are on the side of the law, and that they not be corrupted and collaborate with the criminals,‚Äù Medina said. The governor also used his press conference to complain that his state prisons are overcrowded with inmates facing federal charges for drug and weapons trafficking, kidnapping and extortion. He said that in Nuevo Leon state, 60 percent of all inmates are incarcerated for federal crimes. Mexico is engaged in a prison building boom, and new guards are being trained by the U.S. government. But the handful of new maximum security federal prisons cannot keep up with the flow of criminals. The Mexican government has been overwhelmed by huge numbers of arrests in its five-year, military-led, U.S.-backed war against organized crime. Prisons are now jammed with inmates, including many who await convictions in poorly run, antiquated, dangerous state prisons, where many criminals continue to run their operations via courier and cellphone. According to the Associated Press, all 2,500 inmates in Apodaca prison were incarcerated for federal crimes, and as many as 70 percent had yet to be convicted. The inmate population there grew by 1,500 in the past year to 180 percent of capacity, the result of a crackdown on organized crime and drug trafficking.

      "Doc:  Flu strain confirmed in Calvert deaths Friday, March 9, 2012 15:00:11 GMT-05:00 Four members of the Calvert County family stricken by flu complications had the same H3N2 strain of the influenza A virus, Maryland health officials said Friday. That strain is one of three seasonal varieties circulating in Maryland and nationwide, officials said. Previous testing had identified influenza A but not the specific subtype. Lou Ruth Blake, 81, died at home March 1, and two of her children, Lowell, 58, and Vanessa, 56, who had cared for her, were hospitalized March 4 and died the next day. A third child, Elaine, 51, who lived with her mother and had been her main caregiver, was hospitalized March 5 and discharged late Thursday, a MedStar Washington Hopital Center spokeswoman said. A fifth family member, a sister of Lou Ruth Blake‚Äôs, is still at the hospital center but improving, the spokeswoman said. Lou Ruth Blake had received a seasonal flu vaccination but none of the three adult children received one, Calvert County Health Officer David Rogers has said. This season‚Äôs vaccine protects against two strains of influenza A ‚Äî H3N2 and H1N1 ‚Äî and influenza B. State health officials confirmed Friday, as county officials had earlier said they suspected, that the two siblings who died also had a bacterial infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a known and dangerous complication of influenza infection. MRSA is a strain of a bacterium normally treated with common antibiotics in the penicillin family, such as methicillin. Antibiotic-resistant strains of the organism, however, have been turning up increasingly in places outside health-care settings. The two siblings developed severe bacterial pneumonia, which is not uncommon in people infected with the flu virus. The flu virus weakens and damages the lungs, making the person more susceptible to bacterial infections. The Blakes are part of a large extended family in Lusby that traces its roots back several generations. Officials said no additional related severe respiratory illnesses have been confirmed and no other similar clusters have been identified anywhere in Maryland. This year‚Äôs flu season, however, has started late; the flu season typically can last as late as May.\n",

      "Doc:  U.S. automakers in race for Indian market Sunday, March 18, 2012 16:58:00 GMT-05:00 SANAND, India ‚Äî On a baking-hot plain in western India, Ford is preparing the ground for one of its biggest investments in Asia, a $1 billion car assembly and engine plant designed to more than double its manufacturing capacity here. As U.S. automakers get back on their feet after the global financial crisis, companies such as Ford and General Motors are looking for growth and investment opportunities worldwide. Few destinations appear more attractive than India, and perhaps no other place in India is more appealing than an emerging auto hub in the western state of Gujarat. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get many chances to make an investment of this magnitude,‚Äù said Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Asia Pacific and Africa. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bet on India‚Äôs future, and a bet on Ford‚Äôs future in the country and the region.‚Äù With the West‚Äôs economies sluggish and car markets there saturated, and with China‚Äôs explosive growth beginning to taper off, India offers a mouth-watering alternative. Passenger car sales grew 137 percent in the past six years, but there are still only about 13 cars per 1,000 people in this country of 1.2 billion, compared with 35 or 40 in China and more than 800 in the United States. India is the world‚Äôs sixth-largest car market and is expected to take third place behind China and the United States by the end of the decade, the management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicts, with annual sales growth of 12 to 14 percent from 2014 to 2020. That would bring sales of cars and sport-utility vehicles to more than 6 million vehicles and penetration of cars per 1,000 people to the sort of levels currently seen in China. Ford has been a little slow to the party, perhaps because it had neither the financial resources nor the products to target the Indian market aggressively. Despite opening an assembly plant in the southern city of Chennai in 1998, Ford‚Äôs market share is just 3 percent here, compared with 17 percent in the United States and 10 percent in Brazil. But as new, smaller models such as the Figo make inroads into the Indian market, the company is confident that it can make up lost ground. This new focus on India has required something of a philosophical shift for America‚Äôs big auto manufacturers, a post-downturn realization that the old ways of doing business no longer guarantee success, said Michael Dunne, president of Dunne and Co., a Hong-Kong based investment advisory firm specializing in Asia‚Äôs car markets. In the past, U.S. carmakers tended to launch products in emerging markets that were successful in Europe ‚Äúand anticipate that customers will trade up to the higher price level,‚Äù Dunne said. ‚ÄúThat has worked in other car markets, but it didn‚Äôt work in India, which is quite price-sensitive. They have now realized, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got to go to the market, we can‚Äôt wait for the market to come to us.‚Äô ‚Äù That means smaller, cheaper cars and taking the battle to more-established Asian operators such as Toyota and Hyundai. It means adapting faster than ever before to rapidly changing tastes. But the potential rewards mean that this is a battle that American carmakers can no longer avoid. A decade of breakneck economic growth and a fast-expanding middle class are bringing India close to a ‚Äútipping point,‚Äù when incomes in towns and smaller cities across the country reach the threshold at which car sales typically explode. That should happen by the middle of this decade, Ford‚Äôs Hinrichs said, and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs when we expect another dramatic growth phase.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  Annapolis teen stranded for more than nine hours on capsized boat Sunday, April 8, 2012 17:29:14 GMT-05:00 The way 18-year-old Thomas Lundvall told it to investigators, he had spent Saturday fixing up a sailboat with his dad. About midnight, he got the urge to test it out. But when Lundvall took the 16-foot 1988 daysailer to the mouth of the Severn River, a strong gust caused it to capsize in the cold water, authorities said. The Annapolis teenager would spend the next nine hours aboard the overturned boat until a navigator on a passing freighter spotted him waving and yelling for help in the early morning light, authorities said. ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt for the person on board the freighter being vigilant and seeing the individual, we could be looking at our first fatality of the year,‚Äù said Sgt. Art Windemuth, a spokesman for the Maryland Natural Resources Police. After a harrowing experience, authorities said, the ending will be a happy one for Lundvall. Lt. j.g. Salomee Fisher of the Coast Guard said that rescuers pulled the teen from atop his boat and that he is ‚Äúexpected to recuperate.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre happy to have a good ending to this Easter morning ordeal,‚Äù Fisher said, ‚Äúand happy to have a mariner safe at home with his family today.‚Äù The outcome had been far from certain. By the time emergency responders from the Coast Guard, Anne Arundel County Fire Department and Natural Resources Police were alerted to Lundvall‚Äôs plight about 8:30 a.m., he had been stranded since about midnight, authorities said. Data from Wundergound.com show that temperatures dropped to about 44 degrees in the early morning hours Sunday, and Windemuth said the water temperature was in the low 50s. Lundvall could barely communicate with the rescuers who reached him shortly after 9 a.m., and his core body temperature had dropped to 87 degrees, authorities said. He was flown to a hospital for treatment of hypothermia, authorities said. Windemuth said the teen told investigators that a gust capsized the boat about a mile north of the Annapolis anchorage. Lundvall had not told anyone where he was going, and authorities said the teen‚Äôs father was unaware that he had taken the boat out. Investigators are looking into whether alcohol played a role in the incident, Windemuth said. A relative of Lundvall‚Äôs declined to comment on Sunday. Windemuth said that Maryland had an unusually high 25 boating deaths last year, up from an annual average of 12. He added that although there have been no fatalities in the state so far this year, incidents such as Lundvall‚Äôs should remind mariners about the need to tell others where they are going and carry communication equipment.

      "Doc:  Georgetown University crafts a plan to improve relations with neighbors Thursday, June 7, 2012 22:56:09 GMT-05:00 Georgetown University officials on Thursday announced that they would build additional on-campus student housing, provide more late-night food options and require students to take etiquette classes that would explain how to be a good neighbor. The plan, which needs to be approved by the District‚Äôs zoning commission, comes after years of complaints from residents sick of loud, drunken parties in the heart of one of the city‚Äôs most upscale neighborhoods. University President John DeGioia said that over time, the university has realized the often adverse impact it has had on the surrounding community. The new agreement, he said, aligns the interests of the university and neighborhood, providing ‚Äúthe opportunity to be good neighbors and contributing members of our city.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have come to realize Georgetown is a university and a neighborhood,‚Äù DeGioia said. The Georgetown University Campus Plan calls for the university to move 65 students on campus from the ‚ÄúMagis Row‚Äù townhouses on 36th Street by fall 2013. The townhouses would be made into faculty and staff housing and possibly administrative offices. In addition, the campus‚Äô Leavey Center Hotel would be converted into undergraduate housing for 450 students by fall 2015. The university aims to have 90 percent of its students living on campus by 2025. The university also plans to improve the on-campus social scene next school year by bringing food trucks to campus during late-night hours. It also hopes to complete the New South Student Center ‚Äî which would have a pub ‚Äî in the next two years. To help alleviate parking problems, the university said it would promote the use of satellite parking, car-sharing services and expand the use of Capital Bikeshare on campus. Students living off campus would have to complete a seminar that would focus on ‚Äúappropriate conduct in the off-campus community.‚Äù In the long term, the university said it would be looking for 100 acres in the Washington area on which it could locate some graduate programs. The university‚Äôs initial 10-year plan submitted to the zoning commission last year had focused on new buildings, renovating old ones and even increasing its graduate and professional student population by 40 percent. But surrounding neighborhood associations quickly mobilized to block the university‚Äôs plan, saying that not enough was being done to provide more on-campus housing and fearing additional noise, parties and trouble. After negotiating with the university and city, the neighborhood associations now say they are pleased. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now going to be more of a privilege than a right to live off campus, and hopefully that will get more responsible citizens living next to us,‚Äù said Jennifer Altemus, the president of the Citizens Association of Georgetown. ‚ÄúThe plan really does address immediate short-term issues with a more welcoming residential community atmosphere, clearer rules about acceptable behavior off campus and better parking arrangements . . . a lot of things that will make a difference,‚Äù said Ron Lewis, Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E commissioner. ‚ÄúWhen a great community and a fine university come together, this is how it should work.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  The Influence Industry: New egg lobby heats debate over hen-house legislation Wednesday, June 20, 2012 21:55:54 GMT-05:00 Last summer, the United Egg Producers and the Humane Society of the United States agreed on legislation that would set national standards for the treatment of laying hens, setting aside years of enmity over the issue. But the development did not sit well with Amon Baer, an egg farmer and pork producer in Minnesota who says he decided to set up his own Washington lobbying group in response. The group, dubbed Egg Farmers of America, has joined with much larger agribusiness organizations in mounting strong opposition to the proposed egg legislation, which is part of the broader debate over a farm bill now convulsing Congress. The debate has pitted the egg industry‚Äôs largest lobbying group against other agricultural interests, as well as producing a split within the egg industry itself. Under the proposal, the average size of cages for laying hens would be doubled and new federal standards would be imposed for hygiene, cage-free labeling and other measures. Although the proposal appears stalled in the Senate, backers are hoping for approval in the House. The Humane Society views the deal as an important move forward in the treatment of poultry, while the egg producers group favors the legislation in part because it would do away with a confusing patchwork of state-by-state standards. But Baer said his organization has dozens of members, primarily in the upper Midwest, who would be financially devastated by new requirements in the legislation. Large agribusiness groups such as the Farm Bureau and the National Pork Producers Council also oppose the bill because they fear it could set a precedent for tougher federal regulation of their industries. ‚ÄúWe just feel we‚Äôre not represented by UEP,‚Äù said Baer, who is a UEP board member. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not representing the interests of mid-size and smaller producers.‚Äù Animal-welfare advocates, meanwhile, accuse Baer‚Äôs Egg Farmers of America of acting as a Trojan horse for the pork industry and other agribusiness interests firmly opposed to tougher federal regulations. Paul Shapiro, vice president for farm animal protection at the Humane Society, said the new egg group has helped provide cover for the meat industry and other lobbying groups with little direct interest in the egg business. ‚ÄúThey had to fabricate this organization in order to make it appear that there is egg industry opposition, when in reality the majority of egg producers support this legislation,‚Äù Shapiro said. ‚ÄúBecause the bill doesn‚Äôt affect cattle or pigs, they‚Äôve had a hard time finding sympathy for their arguments.‚Äù The lobbying firm hired by the Egg Farmers of America, the Russell Group of Arlington, also represents the National Pork Producers Council, the International Dairy Foods Association, Hormel and many other large agribusiness interests, according to lobbying records. Baer‚Äôs group has paid Russell $70,000 for lobbying since the fourth quarter of last year, the records show. Tyson Redpath, a lobbyist at Russell, said there was ‚Äúabsolutely no connection‚Äù between the Egg Farmers of America and his firm‚Äôs other clients. He said Baer approached the firm after deciding to form his organization. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an ad-hoc coalition of small- and medium-sized egg farmers who don‚Äôt feel that the [United] Egg Producers represent their interests,‚Äù Redpath said. ‚ÄúThey are using their right to advocate before Congress their opposition to this agreement, and opposition to federally legislating hen housing standards nationwide.‚Äù Dave Warner, a spokesman for the pork producers lobby, said the council played no role in forming the egg farmers group but has joined sides to oppose the hen treatment legislation. United Egg Producers, based in Alpharetta, Ga., is a cooperative lobbying group that says its members account for 88 percent of the 80 billion eggs produced in the United States each year. The group had long opposed mandated cage sizes and other limits, and has spent years attempting to fend off state-level regulations around the country.\n",

      "Doc:  Without power, elderly seek help at hospitals Thursday, July 5, 2012 19:07:41 GMT-05:00 Among those who have been hardest hit by the stifling heat in their out-of-power residences are the elderly. Hospitals across the region said their emergency rooms were treating elderly patients who live at home alone, without relatives in the area, and who use oxygen machines that rely on electricity. At Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, the hospital set a record immediately after the storm for the most patients seen in a 48-hour period in its emergency department, spokeswoman Susan Laine said Thursday. Suburban treated about 150 patients each day between Saturday and Monday. A significant number of patients had symptoms of heat exhaustion. Many were elderly. Some were from area nursing homes that had lost power. Others went to the hospital because the outages closed their primary care doctors‚Äô offices. By Tuesday and Wednesday, the numbers had dropped a bit, but the emergency department treated about 130 cases Tuesday and about 100 Wednesday, Laine said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve just been slammed,‚Äù she said. On Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were in the emergency department waiting room, she added. Since the weekend, about 50 percent of the cases at Suburban have been heat-related ‚Äî mostly dehydration, shortness of breath and headaches, she said. But hospitals around the region also are seeing injuries from trips and falls, possibly from people cleaning up storm debris in their yards. Six days after the storm, elderly patients who do not have power for their oxygen or other life-saving equipment were still showing up at Suburban‚Äôs emergency room, Laine said. The majority are from private residences, but hospital officials said there may still be nursing homes that do not have power. A 78-year-old woman who neighbors said was suffering from dehydration was taken by ambulance to Suburban Hospital from the Old Farm neighborhood in Rockville. She was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. Many homes in that neighborhood and nearby Tilden Woods, where trees have downed power lines and transformers, have been without electricity since the storm. Suburban‚Äôs pediatrics emergency department also has had an increase in patients because parents have been unable to go to pediatricians‚Äô offices to get asthma treatments for their children, she said. Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring has had between 10 and 20 heat-related cases, a spokeswoman said. At Inova Fairfax Hospital, the largest number of patients have been the elderly using oxygen, spokeswoman Joanna Fazio said. The hospital set up a special process for such patients so they could be admitted directly to an observation unit where they could be comfortable, allowing the emergency department to be freed up for additional cases, she said. Most of the elderly did not arrive via ambulance but went to the hospital as a backup because of outages, Fazio said. Inova Fairfax also has seen an uptick in trauma from car accidents and injuries incurred while cleaning up fallen trees. At MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, the emergency department is continuing to see about a 20 percent bump in daily visits. Mostly, those coming in are dizzy, have fainted or feel like they are going to faint. Patients include residents with heat-related illnesses who had lost power, as well as some tourists, spokeswoman Marianne Worley said. MedStar Washington Hospital Center, in northwest Washington, had a 15 to 30 percent increase in ER visits on Monday and Tuesday, but the number has fallen since. Many patients were without power, and the heat aggravated chronic conditions, spokesman Matt Brock said. The hospital had to set aside public space for some patients who were ready to be discharged but couldn‚Äôt return home because of a lack of power. The hospital helped find them a cooling center or relatives who could care for them. By Thursday, MedStar Washington reported that visits were back to normal ‚Äî about 40 patients by mid-day.\n",

      "Doc:  Militants storm Pakistan air base; 10 killed Wednesday, August 15, 2012 23:04:00 GMT-05:00 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan‚Äî Armed militants stormed a major Pakistani air force base early Thursday, sparking an hours-long firefight with security forces and raising concerns about the military‚Äôs ability to subdue insurgents. Nine militants and one Pakistani military official were killed in the attack, which began about 2 a.m. local time at the Minhas base, about 37 miles northwest of Islamabad, an air force spokesman said. The militants were armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the militants wore suicide vests, the spokesman said. One fighter aircraft was damaged in the attack. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Its spokesman, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said the attack was revenge for military actions in the tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. He said the attack was carried out by four suicide bombers, but the air force indicated that nine militants were involved. Ihsan also claimed that the attackers killed ‚Äúdozens of security people‚Äù in the assault. ‚ÄúWe could do anything and target whatever we want,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur fighters can hit any target anywhere.‚Äù Separately Thursday, the Pakistani Taliban‚Äôs Darra Adam Khel faction claimed responsibility for a targeted sectarian attack near the city of Gilgit in northwestern Pakistan. In the dawn attack, gunmen ambushed three buses, forced passengers out and shot 22 of them dead, the Reuters news service quoted officials as saying. The officials said the assailants checked passengers‚Äô ID cards and then opened fire on the Shiites. ‚ÄúThey are enemies of Sunnis and conspire against us,‚Äù Mohammed Afridi, a spokesman for the faction, told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location, referring to Shiites. ‚ÄúWe will continue such attacks in the future.‚Äù In the assault on the base, intense clashes between air force commandos and the insurgents lasted for more than two hours, an air force spokesman said. The commander of the base, Air Commodore Muhammad Azam, who was leading the operations against the attackers, was shot and injured in the shoulder, the air force spokesman said. He was reported in stable condition. The Minhas base, in the town of Kamra, houses the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, the manufacturing division of the air force. It builds French-designed Mirage fighter planes and, with Chinese support, JF-17 fighter jets. Some reports suggested that the air base housed part of Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear arsenal, but the air force spokesman denied the reports. Security analysts also said it was not true that Pakistan keeps nuclear assets at a base or a military garrison. ‚ÄúNuclear assets management is totally a separate issue and is being dealt with separately,‚Äù said Mahmood Shah, a former brigadier general in the Pakistani army. ‚ÄúNo nuclear arsenals are being kept in the known places, such as the air or naval bases or military cantonment areas.‚Äù He said the attackers appeared to have good knowledge of the area and the base. ‚ÄúIts not the work of half-educated Taliban militants, but the handiwork of al-Qaeda planners‚Äù Shah said. He added that unlike in the Pakistani army, discipline in the air force and navy is loose that needs to be tightened. The attackers, some wearing military uniforms, moved through a nearby village under cover of darkness and climbed a nine-foot wall strung with barbed wire to break into the base, according to Reuters news agency. Security forces opened fire when militants strapped with suicide bombing vests approached aircraft hangars, prompting other militants to fire rocket-propelled grenades from outside the base‚Äôs walls, Reuters reported, citing the air force spokesman. In May last year, a few days after the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, militants carried out a similar attack on a Pakistani naval base in the southern city of Karachi. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack, in which about 10 security personnel were killed and the militants destroyed two aircraft built by the United States.\n",

      "Doc:  Facebook, Twitter and data access Monday, September 24, 2012 15:01:00 GMT-05:00 Users will have a little more access to their social data, thanks to new features from Facebook and plans from Twitter announced last week. Facebook has begun allowing users to search and edit their site search history, the company said in a Friday announcement. Users will be able to view and edit their search history, which is not viewable for anyone other than users. The introduction of the additional feature has raised speculation about whether Facebook will be moving into the search space in the future, particularly given chief executive Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs comment at TechCrunch Disrupt last week. Zuckerberg, as TechCrunch reports, said that his company will be looking at search ‚Äúat some point‚Äù and that it has a team looking at the function. For now, though, it simply means that you have a little more control over your data on Facebook. Twitter also is moving toward giving users a little more data control. At last week‚Äôs Online News Association conference, Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo said that he‚Äôs pushing his developers to have a tool in place that lets users download all their tweets by the end of the year ‚Äî if the technology permits. That feature is one that users of the service have long-requested, and one, GigaOm reported, that some are skeptical Twitter will deliver. In his comments on Costolo‚Äôs talk, prominent blogger Dave Winer said that if Twitter does let users download their tweets, he believes it will be in ‚ÄúGIF format or PDF,‚Äù or another format that will not let you take your data to another service. Other social networks, including Facebook and Google+ allow users to download some data from social networks to keep their own record of their activity on the services. (Washington Post Co. Chairman and chief executive Donald E. Graham is a member of Facebook‚Äôs board of directors.)

      "Doc:  Social media killing the secret ballot? Tuesday, November 6, 2012 13:33:02 GMT-05:00 One of every five registered voters will share how they voted online, according to a new report by the Pew Internet & American Life Project. The report, \"Social Media and Voting,\" also found that nearly a third of registered voters have been encouraged to vote one way or the other by contacts on Facebook or Twitter -- a number that rises among voters under 30. If that sounds like a lot of tweets and Facebook posts, you're right. The word \"election\" has appeared in more than 1.5 million tweets today alone, according to Topsy, and in the past 24 hours, both President Obama and Mitt Romney's names have been tweeted several million times. The Twitter popularity of the presidential debate in Denver -- 10 million tweets in 90 minutes -- even has some pundits speculating that today's election could be the most-tweeted event of all time. On Facebook, 2.8 million people in the United States have shared they're voting today, and the number is climbing. (See Facebook's map tracking voter's posts here). There's some danger in public posting. At the extreme end, All Things D reports photographing your ballot could land you in jail. Less troubling, it could annoy your friends and family. If you're on the receiving end of too much #electionday chatter, several plug-ins let you mute noisy tweeters or topics for a designated length of time. Mute Tweets and Mute.ly can both hide specific users until the polls close; Chrome browser extensions like PBTweet will also let you do this, among a host of other things. Proxlet, another Chrome extension, can also filter out hashtags and topics of your choice. (Try #election2012, #obama or #romneyryan2012.) If you use Tweetdeck, you're in luck: A filter function is built into the tool's settings. Facebook isn't quite as easy; your best bet is unfollowing posts from particularly chatty friends. If you're seeing a lot of notifications from a political post you liked or commented on earlier in the day, you can also hide those. Click on the post date, and an option to \"unfollow post\" will appear at the bottom of the box, next to \"like\" and \"comment.\" No matter what you do on social media, though, don't expect to avoid political discussion entirely. While the Pew report found an increase in election day social media sharing, the most popular way to talk politics is still face-to-face. More than half of Pew's respondents said someone had tried to persuade them to vote for Obama or Romney in person in the past 30 days.\n",

      "Doc:  Riverdale Park takes steps to engage Hispanic community Wednesday, November 14, 2012 17:53:02 GMT-05:00 As Riverdale Park has seen a boom in the number of its Hispanic and immigrant residents, town officials have taken steps to ensure that the population is integrated into the town‚Äôs affairs. But reaching out to the Hispanic population has offered some challenges, Mayor Vernon Archer said. Town officials have sought to ensure Hispanic participation in civic and community events by hiring more bilingual staff and translating some of the town‚Äôs literature into Spanish, Archer said. The town‚Äôs Hispanic population climbed to 50 percent in 2010, up from 28 percent in 2000, according to U.S. Census data. In 2010, 40 percent of the town‚Äôs population was foreign-born, and 30 percent spoke a language other than English in the home, data show. George Escobar, director of the services department for the immigrant rights group Casa of Maryland, said he thinks the population is increasing because many Hispanics have family in the area and there are more affordable housing options than in Montgomery County and the District. Officials have hired bilingual staff for almost every department and translated into Spanish some important town literature, such as invitations to the town‚Äôs Oct. 6 Riverdale Park Day and information on new developments, Archer said. Most of the translated literature is distributed on the eastern side of town, where most Spanish-speaking residents live, Archer said. However, because many Hispanic residents live in apartments and move often, the large amount of turnover in the town‚Äôs population makes it tough to engage over long periods, he said. ‚ÄúThe people you tried to reach out to five years ago are gone,‚Äù Archer said. ‚ÄúThe demographics are the same, but they are a different group of people.‚Äù Escobar said the high amount of turnover is expected because the area generally has a highly transitional population. He said because many Hispanic residents do seasonal and temporary jobs, they may be moving to where the work is. Some in the town believe that more interpreters should be present at Town Hall and that more literature should be distributed in Spanish. Riverdale Park resident Erick Mendez said he has never visited Town Hall. Originally from Mexico, Mendez, 28, lives in a multifamily apartment complex along Riverdale Road with his parents. He said he felt there was a lack of staff who spoke Spanish at Town Hall, making it difficult for him and his primarily Spanish-speaking family to become engaged in the town‚Äôs affairs. ‚ÄúSome people don‚Äôt speak English; they have always spoke Spanish,‚Äù Mendez said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for them to write stuff and to read because they do not understand what they are talking about.‚Äù While overcoming the language barrier is important when trying to engage the Hispanic and immigrant population in any jurisdiction, it is crucial to develop leaders who come directly from the community to inspire activism, Escobar said. ‚ÄúTranslating and having bilingual people is great and necessary, but it is only part of the solution,‚Äù Escobar said. ‚ÄúIt is really important to spend resources on getting people to be champions of the community themselves.‚Äù Archer said he recruited the town‚Äôs two Hispanic council members ‚Äî Raymond Rivas (Ward 5) and Alejandro Silva (Ward 6) ‚Äî by knocking on their doors and asking them to run in the two wards, which have a large Hispanic population. He said he believed the two wards needed representatives who reflected the communities. Rivas won his seat in 2009 and won reelection in 2011, running unopposed both times. He declined to comment for this article. Silva won his seat in 2011 and also ran unopposed. Silva said he thought the town has done well in reaching out to the Hispanic population and felt that the number of translators was adequate to handle Spanish-speakers in the town. He said Hispanic residents in his ward usually come to him if they have any concerns about town issues.\n",

      "Doc:  New language, same findings: Tax hikes on the rich won‚Äôt cripple the economy Thursday, December 13, 2012 15:33:05 GMT-05:00 Under pressure from Senate Republicans, the Congressional Research Service withdrew a September report that concluded that there was no correlation between top individual tax rates and economic growth. Republicans claimed that the report was biased in tone and faulted its methodology, and convinced the agency to remove the report from circulation. The CRS has now released a revised edition of the report that changes some of the language that Republicans had found most objectionable, bolsters the arguments cited in favor of tax cuts and clarifies its methodology. But its underlying conclusion about the Bush tax cuts remains the same. The nonpartisan office, which is part of the Library of Congress, denies that it was simply acting at the whim of Republicans. \"CRS decided to report on its own,\" said spokesperson Janine D'Addario, stressing the office's commitment to objectivity. \"To my knowledge, we have never withdrawn a report based solely on comments from Congress.\" But many of the changes reflect the GOP's criticism of the original report. Republicans were incensed that the original report referred to \"tax rates on the rich,\" which the CRS has revised to \"high-income taxpayers.\" The new version of the CRS report is also padded with new citations to research in support of Republicans' view that tax cuts view economic growth. In the original report, for instance, the report says that \"some have argued that raising tax rates, especially on higher-income taxpayers, to increase tax revenues is part of the solution for long-term debt reduction.\" The new report pairs this statement (\"On the one hand ...) with the contrary view (\"On the other hand, others argue that maintaining low tax rates is necessary to foster economic growth\"), citing a House bill for extending the Bush tax cuts that had originally just been a footnote. The revised report also includes a new section called \"methods\" that details how the researcher, Thomas Hungerford, went about examining the correlation between tax rates and economic growth. Both sides are claiming some kind of vindication. The Republicans who blasted the original report say they're pleased it got another look. \"While we don‚Äôt necessarily agree with its conclusions, hats off to CRS for hearing out our concerns and agreeing that the report needed to be modified to reach their standards,\" says Antonia Ferrier, a spokesperson for the Senate GOP Finance Committee. But House Democrats stress the fact that the bottom line of the report remains exactly the same: \"The results of the analysis suggest that changes over the past 65 years in the top margin rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth.\"\n",

      "Doc:  With U.S. awash in natural gas, why aren‚Äôt fuel bills falling? Friday, December 14, 2012 06:35:46 GMT-05:00 Here‚Äôs a question a lot of homeowners are asking: If there is so much cheap natural gas floating around the United States, why aren‚Äôt people‚Äôs fuel bills falling? The answer is that fuel is only part of the fuel bill. A lot of what homeowners pay goes to building new power lines or tending to aging gas pipelines. In one recent rate case, a utility got a rate increase to cover pension costs. Moreover, electric utilities, burned by sudden natural gas price spikes last decade, have learned to spread out contract negotiations. For Pepco, each year it bids for a third of the electricity it needs from power suppliers. That smooths out changes in electricity prices, but it also delays the full effect of lower prices. ‚ÄúIn the contracts we‚Äôve been receiving, we are seeing a reduction in the supply cost that is driving the energy portions of the bills down,‚Äù said Bill Gausman, senior vice president of strategic initiatives for Pepco Holdings. ‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre only bidding a third of our supplies, the impact is not as big.‚Äù Most electric utilities also rely on a variety of energy sources. Cheap natural gas, the result of new supplies of shale gas in the past four or five years, is moderating fuel prices. But it is just one part of the fuel cost that includes coal, nuclear and renewables that go into a regional grid. Pepco says 72.2 percent of the typical electricity bill in the District is made up of fuel costs, while distribution eats up 19.2 percent; transmission, 2.2 percent; and surcharges and taxes, 6.4 percent. Low natural gas prices did not stop Washington Gas earlier this year from seeking a revenue increase of 14 percent from regulators on the D.C. Public Service Commission. ‚ÄúWGL is proposing to expand an existing program for replacing and encapsulating certain old mechanical couplings,‚Äù the PSC said. It said Washington Gas was approved ‚Äúto include the accelerated replacement of pipes in its system that are nearing the end of their useful life.‚Äù But the customers of gas utilities are getting some benefits from the low natural gas prices. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not seeing the same unaffordable bills people were opening up four or five years ago,‚Äù said Tyler Slocum, an energy expert at Public Citizen. ‚ÄúIt was just astronomical. You‚Äôre not seeing that level.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  After Newtown shooting, Girl Scouts come together to support their own Friday, December 21, 2012 19:23:41 GMT-05:00 NEWTOWN, Conn. ‚Äî Eight of the 12 girls killed in last week‚Äôs shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School were Girl Scouts. Two troops of the smallest scouts were shattered. One that had 10 members now has five. Another troop of five girls now has just two. Girl Scouts are particularly active in Newtown, with 125 troops involving more than 700 girls, and now as the town struggles to overcome its grief, Girls Scouts are relying on their troop friendships and activities to recover a bit of their sense of normalcy. ‚ÄúWe were together when we were strong, and we‚Äôre going to stay together now that we‚Äôre Newtown Strong,‚Äù said Kelsea ¬≠Morshuk-Allen, a 16-year-old Girl Scout, using a term that is emerging as a sign of this town‚Äôs resilience. Small indications of that attitude are everywhere, such as the sign ‚ÄúNewtown Strong‚Äù that appeared under the scoreboard when the high school basketball team returned to the court Wednesday. Or the campaign to create a memorial fund from the sale of thousands of $2 ‚ÄúNewtown Angels‚Äù bracelets, a campaign with the slogan, ‚ÄúNewtown Strong. Newtown Proud.‚Äù Or Kelsea‚Äôs ‚ÄúGone but not Forgotten‚Äù ¬≠T-shirt made in a high school graphics class. Kelsea and her friend Brooke Hadgraft, 15, met a decade ago as Girl Scout Daisies, as the troops for kindergartners and first-graders are called. Those killed in the massacre were Daisies. Now Kelsea and Brooke and their fellow scouts plan to mentor the remaining girls in the two affected troops ‚Äî all of whom survived the shooting at the Sandy Hook school. Scout leaders are planning on combining the two troops that lost eight girls into one and pairing the little girls who lost so many of their friends with Kelsea‚Äôs troop of older scouts. A monument to the lost girls is being planned, as is a major event in January, where the 3 million women and girls involved in Girl Scouts worldwide will remember the eight little Girl Scouts of Newtown. Robbin Chaber Allen, Kelsea‚Äôs mother and the chief Girl Scouts organizer in Newtown, said the mother of one of the girls who died called her and urged her to use scouting as a way of remembering the girls. Four of the mothers whose daughters were killed are also Girl Scout leaders, Allen said. ‚ÄúShe wanted to make sure we did something that was positive, as opposed to just being about sadness,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe hope they lean on us and grow with us. We have to take this and make something beautiful come out of it.‚Äù Brooke, who like Kelsea is a sophomore at Newtown High, said she had worked with one of the girls who was killed when she was in a child development class that pairs high school students with preschoolers. In a small town with so many people involved in scouting, nearly everyone has a personal connection to someone who was killed. ‚ÄúThere was a lot to cry about,‚Äù Brooke said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot to recover from, but we have to get stronger, and we will. That‚Äôs the truth.‚Äù The Boy Scouts are also popular here in this town of rolling hills and wide-open spaces, where the scouts camp and organize public service projects such as building houses for the poor. About 550 boys and 180 adult volunteers participate in Boy Scouts. Two of the eight boys killed were from the same Cub Scouts pack, and three other members of the 80-boy pack lost a sibling, said Tony Vogl, a Boy Scouts spokesman. In a show of solidarity, Boy Scouts and Girls Scouts from far beyond Newtown attended the funerals held here this week.\n",

      "Doc:  Could a port strike really cripple the U.S. economy? Thursday, December 27, 2012 12:08:10 GMT-05:00 The fiscal cliff is no longer the only threat facing the U.S. economy. Some 14,500 dockworkers from Baltimore to Texas are threatening to strike this week, a move that could throttle an array of key ports and disrupt commerce across the nation. For months, negotiations have dragged on between the dockworkers' union and the group that represents shippers and port operators ‚Äî their disagreements have centered on container royalties, which are used to augment worker wages and benefits. Without a resolution, dockworkers are poised to strike at 14 shipping-container ports starting Sunday, including Boston, New York-New Jersey, Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah, Miami and Houston. \"This is truly a ‚Äòcontainer cliff‚Äô in the making,\" warned Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation‚Äôs vice president for supply chain policy. So how much economic damage would a port strike cause? Estimates can vary widely. Business groups claim that a comparable 11-day lockout at ports on the West Coast in 2002 cost the economy $1 billion per day, or nearly 4 percent of the nation's output during that period. Yet other economists have argued that these figures are often inflated and that the economy can handle temporary disruptions. There's no question that the 14 threatened ports on the East Coast and Gulf Coast are critical ‚Äî nearly half of ocean-going shipping containers coming to and from the United States go through these points. The biggest port, New York-New Jersey, handled $208 billion worth of goods last year. And the dock workers, for their part, have enormous control over the loading and unloading of cargo. \"Many of them, like the crane operators who transfer containers from ships to the docks, are highly skilled and cannot be easily replaced,\" writes Steven Greenhouse of the New York Times. Still, calculating how a port shutdown would affect the economy is notoriously tricky, not least because it's difficult to figure out how supply chains will adapt. As Peter V. Hall of the University of Waterloo explained in a 2004 paper, many past studies simply assume that most of the value of the cargo will be lost during a shutdown and that all the jobs that depend on that cargo, from truckers to retailers, will take a hit accordingly. \"In other words,\" Hall writes, \"they assume the ships carrying the cargo sank.\" But, Hall explained, that's too simplistic. Many companies stock up on extra goods ahead of an anticipated labor dispute. And, in the event of a port shutdown, many supply-chain managers will ship goods by rail or air instead ‚Äî air freight surged during the 2002 lockout at Los Angeles-Long Beach. These contingency plans do cost money, so there is a real loss here, but it's smaller than often assumed. That explains why academic estimates of the costs of the 2002 lockout have ranged from many billions of dollars per day to just $2.5 billion in total. That's the difference between a mild disruption and economic doom. Making things even more complicated is the fact that the looming dockworkers' strike on the East Coast won't affect all cargo ‚Äî just containerized cargo such as household goods, clothing, and frozen foods. As a strike-preparation memo from the International Longshoremen's Association explained, workers will still handle U.S. mail, military cargo, perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables, as well as non-containerized \"break bulk\" goods such as cars, wood products, and steel. What's more, certain industries may suffer more than others. U.S. grain exporters, for instance, are already reeling from both the recent slowdown in China and low water levels on the Mississippi that are bogging down barge traffic. An East Coast port shutdown could hamper grain exports even further.\n",

      "Doc:  Expanded Panama Canal sparks race to be ready for bigger cargo ships Saturday, January 12, 2013 17:05:00 GMT-05:00 Editor‚Äôs Note: An earlier version of this article included material borrowed and duplicated, without attribution, from Environmental Health Perspectives, a monthly scientific journal. In that earlier version, four sentences were copied in whole or in substantial part from ‚ÄúProgress and Pollution: Port Cities Prepare for the Panama Canal Expansion,‚Äô‚Äô published on Dec. 3 and written by Andrea Hricko, a professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. It is The Post‚Äôs policy that the use of material from other newspapers or sources must be properly attributed. The Post apologizes to Andrea Hricko, to Environmental Health Perspectives, and to its readers for this serious lapse. PANAMA CITY ‚Äî This is a story about big, and how one of the biggest construction projects in the world, the remaking of the Panama Canal, will let bigger boats sail into deeper harbors, where authorities are spending billions dredging channels, blasting tunnels and buying cranes from China the size of 14-story buildings to accommodate super-sized cargo. All this might knock a couple of dollars off the price of a smartphone shipped from Shanghai ‚Äî or alleviate poverty in Panama, where the government plans to make a fortune in tolls ‚Äî or create a windfall for the ports ready to receive the big ships, such as those in Baltimore and Norfolk. Or not. Nobody‚Äôs sure, because no expert can predict with any certainty how the web of global trade routes will be redrawn, and who the winners and losers might be. But with the $5.25 billion expansion of the Panama Canal now officially half complete, a scramble is on among the hemisphere‚Äôs ports to lure a new generation of elephantine cargo ships, bulk carriers and automobile haulers to their harbors, where boosters envision an economic boom. These new ‚Äúpost-Panamax‚Äù ships are the length of aircraft carriers. From the waterline, they‚Äôre 190 feet tall, or nearly twice the height of the Lincoln Memorial. The ships can carry as many as 12,000 containers, or about a million flat-screen TVs. The crew? A dozen men. A deeper, wider Panama Canal with its two new flights of triple locks will double existing canal capacity and allow transit for vessels with three times the cargo when the upgraded passageway opens for business in early 2015. So important is the race to be ready for the more voluminous ships that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is spending $1 billion to raise the Bayonne Bridge to let the taller vessels pass through. Nobody wants to miss the boat. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that U.S. ports are now spending $6 billion to $8 billion a year in federal, local and private money to modernize. The ships are coming at a time when many experts say U.S. infrastructure ‚Äî in ports, highways, bridges, railroads and tunnels ‚Äî has suffered from delayed maintenance that has undermined U.S. competitiveness. ‚ÄúMaryland‚Äôs Port of Baltimore has a deep harbor, but its old railroad tunnel exiting the port terminals is not tall enough for today‚Äôs double-stacked trains to pass through,‚Äù wrote Andrea Hricko, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern Califrnia, in the Dec. 3 edition of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. ‚ÄúAs a solution, the major railroad company CSX is planning to build a new intermodal railtransfer facility that will facilitate moving double-stacked trains away from the port. The Port of Miami, in Florida, has started boring twin tunnels that would allow big-rig trucks entering or leaving the port to bypass downtown Miami streets, at a cost of $607 million.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  FBI lays out what it wants in a new headquarters Sunday, January 20, 2013 12:48:24 GMT-05:00 It was 35 minutes past the scheduled start time when everyone had finally made their way through the security and Dan Tangherlini, acting administrator of the General Services Administration, took the podium. He assumed by the size of the crowd ‚Äî an estimated 350 people, some of them watching on a screen in an overflow room ‚Äî that there was a lot of interest in building a new headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ‚ÄúI think that bodes pretty well for this project,‚Äù he said. Six weeks after issuing a broad search for ideas of how and where to build a consolidated headquarters for the FBI, developers, Tangherlini and his staff reiterated why they wished to swap the J. Edgar Hoover building property on Pennsylvania Avenue for a new consolidated FBI headquarters: the Hoover building is obsolete and the government has limited capital to build a replacement. For the first time at the meeting Jan. 17, a high-ranking FBI official explained in public exactly what the agency is seeking. Patrick G. Findlay, FBI assistant director for facilities and logistics services, said that from the moment the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks took place, the FBI had evolved into an agency that the Hoover Building could not serve. The Hoover building houses only 52 percent of the agency‚Äôs headquarters staff, with others in Quantico and Clarksburg, W.Va. The northern end of the property was built to house thousands of files and a crime laboratory that had long ago relocated; meanwhile the agency had increased its headquarters staff by 25 percent since the attacks (intelligence analysts, language specialists, scientists and information technology specialists) and lacked enough office space to house them. ‚ÄúWe started putting people in the loading dock and the garage,‚Äù he joked. Findlay, who said he has been working on getting the agency a new home for seven years already, praised Tangherlini for spending six hours meeting with Director Robert S. Mueller, III and touring the Hoover Building within weeks of taking over at the GSA. He then described the agency‚Äôs ideal landing spot: a 2.1 million-square-foot facility on 40 to 55 acres that could accommodate 11,000 employees. ‚ÄúWe are supporters of public transit. A very small portion of headquarters workers drive in individual cars to get to work,‚Äù he said. Responses to an initial search for private partners are due March 4, but a number of steps must be taken for the agency to actually move. The Senate passed a resolution in 2011 supporting a site of up to 55 acres within two miles of a Metro station and 2.5 miles of the Beltway, but the House has never taken corresponding action. Nonetheless, developers, builders, private landowners and local economic development officials have begun lining up their shots either to acquire the 6.66-acre Hoover Building property, win the work building a new FBI headquarters or both. The week prior, Virginia officials met at the urging of Rep. Jim Moran (D) to demonstrate that its members are ‚Äî at least at this point ‚Äî wholly united in making sure the FBI moves to the commonwealth no matter the location. Officials from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership briefed attendees of that meeting on what it considered the most attractive sites: a GSA-owned warehouse in Springfield, the Fort Belvoir North area, the CIT headquarters in Herndon, sites around Dulles Airport, Quantico and Potomac Shores property in Dumfries. Economic development officials for Prince George‚Äôs County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) have been more coy about their best shot at landing the FBI. And not to be forgotten, hours before the GSA and FBI officials held their briefing, D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) told a News Channel 8 interviewer that he thought the agency ought to remain in the District.\n",

      "Doc:  Ford funds expansion of Smithsonian exhibit for young inventors Sunday, February 3, 2013 14:31:51 GMT-05:00 The Ford Motor Co. Fund has announced a $500,000 donation to the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of American History, the largest corporate contribution the museum has received for a program that supports innovation and science for youth. The company made the announcement at the Washington Auto Show at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, where it set up a Spark!Lab exhibit, an interactive inventor‚Äôs workshop. In a large hall surrounded by 40 new Ford cars and trucks, a dozen students from a local elementary school took in the exhibit after a press conference. They designed cars with PVC pipe, created music with marbles and wood, and built model vehicles with dry pasta noodles. The donation represents part of the funding necessary for a $2 million Spark!Lab initiative that includes updating a program at the museum and building labs in three other museums around the country. Spark!Lab in D.C. is set to reopen in the spring of 2015 with expanded space and new activities involving phone apps and video-recording kiosks that allow students to use media to pitch their inventions. The lab is part of a $120 million overhaul of the museum‚Äôs west wing. The federal government put up half of the funding, the other half is to come from private donors. ‚ÄúFord supporting the renovation is huge,‚Äù said Tricia Edwards, an education specialist at the Smithsonian who manages Spark!Labs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be very different than anything else on the National Mall.‚Äù The president of Ford Motor Co. Fund, Jim Vella, sits on the board of the National Museum of American History. He said the foundation was looking for a substantial project to support this year that would also highlight the 150th birthday of the auto company‚Äôs founder Henry Ford. ‚ÄúOne of the things that he was known for was tinkering in innovation,‚Äù Vella said. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs a great partnership for us because it allows us to reach out to young people and get them involved in invention projects that may lead them to [science and engineering careers], which is real important to a company like Ford.‚Äù Ford has partnered with the Smithsonian since 1974, funding exhibitions including Freedom‚Äôs Sisters, an exhibit that highlights little-known woman figures in the civil rights movement. It also gave $400,000 to the National Zoo for its panda Webcam. Edsel Ford II, philanthropist and great grandson of Henry Ford, talked to the elementary school students as they built model cars. Ford, who was raised in a family of philanthropists, said he and his wife became philanthropists in 1980 after returning to Detroit from Australia. He became a major supporter of children‚Äôs causes, and began funding the Salvation Army, the Smithsonian and the Skillman Foundation, which funds school and neighborhood projects in Detroit. Now, as he sits on the board of Ford Motor Co., he travels the country hoping to inspire other business leaders that may not be engaged in philanthropy. ‚ÄúWe need to get executives involved and passionate,‚Äù Edsel said. ‚ÄúSome are and some aren‚Äôt. Once you become a corporate officer of a company, you need to go to a class or school that teaches you these things. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs human nature.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  Lindsey Vonn tears ligaments in violent skiing crash Tuesday, February 5, 2013 18:54:25 GMT-05:00 One year and one week before the women‚Äôs downhill at the Sochi Olympics, American champion Lindsey Vonn suffered debilitating injuries to her right leg in a violent crash during a race at the World Championships in Schladming, Austria, putting her out for the rest of this World Cup season and potentially complicating the defense of her Olympic title. The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association announced Tuesday that Vonn suffered two torn ligaments in her right knee ‚Äî the medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments ‚Äî as well as a fractured lateral tibial plateau in the same knee after crashing in the super-G, skiing‚Äôs second-fastest discipline. Kyle Wilkens, the ski team‚Äôs medical director, said in a statement Vonn ‚Äúis expected to return to racing‚Äù for the 2013-14 World Cup season and the 2014 Olympics, a timeline that would fit what experts say is normal recovery from such ligament tears. The fractured tibial plateau, however, ‚Äúadds a lot of unpredictability,‚Äù said Dr. Leon Popovitz, an orthopedist who is a co-founder of the New York Bone and Joint Specialists. But Dr. Tom Hackett of the Steadman Clinic in Vail, Colo., where Vonn makes her home, said even the broken bone should be something Vonn can overcome by the Olympics. ‚ÄúThe word fracture, it‚Äôs more of a semantic issue,‚Äù said Hackett, whose clinic regularly helps rehabilitate injured skiers. ‚ÄúWhat is really a fracture and what is a bone bruise, and what is the spectrum in between them? It‚Äôs very common to see that with this kind of injury, and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily affect the general recovery time.‚Äù A lateral tibial plateau fracture is common in such cases in skiing, Popovitz said, because the ligament tears minimize the padding between two bones in the leg, the femur and the tibia, and the force of the impact after a jump can cause the bones to bang into each other. Such a fracture could be allowed to heal on its own if it is mild, or, in extreme cases, it could require reconstructive surgery involving screws. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the complicating factor,‚Äù Popovitz said. Video of the crash is harrowing. The race at Schladming had been delayed for hours by fog and began in fading light at 2:30 p.m. local time. Vonn was the 19th racer out of the starting gate, and she skied well at the top of the course, taking a slight lead at the first interval over Slovenia‚Äôs Tina Maze, the best female skier during this World Cup season. But as she came over a jump less than 50 seconds into her run, Vonn drifted slightly off-line. She landed hard on her right leg. Unable to maintain balance, she flipped over in the air, crashed through a gate and landed hard on her back, skidding down the hill, yelling out in pain the entire way before sliding to a stop and screaming some more. ‚ÄúShe jumped a little bit in the wrong direction and started to correct that a little bit in the air and put a lot of pressure on the outside ski exactly in the landing,‚Äù said Atle Skaardal, the International Ski Federation‚Äôs women‚Äôs race director, according to the Associated Press. ‚ÄúAnd she couldn‚Äôt hold the pressure.‚Äù Skaardal added that ‚Äúvisibility was great, there were no problems.‚Äù Vonn was taken to a hospital and released Tuesday afternoon. She will have surgery elsewhere. Maze won the race, with Switzerland‚Äôs Lara Gut taking silver and American Julia Mancuso, Vonn‚Äôs longtime rival, winning bronze.\n",

      "Doc:  The State of the Union game: Hopefuls jockey to get their causes into speech Saturday, February 9, 2013 17:04:00 GMT-05:00 Call it rhetorical earmarking. Every year, interest groups and individuals lobby the White House to get their pet policy issues or coveted causes mentioned in the State of the Union address. And every year, the president, his speechwriters and policy advisers have to decide which agenda items merit a paragraph or sentence, a shout-out or some extra-special form of recognition. This year, gun-control advocates are likely to have the spotlight. The barrage of lobbying and jockeying has become a Washington ritual that is often reviled by those on both sides of the process. ‚ÄúThe State of the Union is the most hated speech by many speechwriters,‚Äù said William McGurn, former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush. ‚ÄúNo matter how many times you vow it won‚Äôt become a laundry list, it becomes a laundry list, if only because it is where the president lays out his legislative priorities.‚Äù In some cases, the most vocal lobbyists can be those from the various departments inside the federal government. ‚ÄúFor someone toiling away on some policy, the State of the Union may be the only chance to elevate that work by getting a presidential mention,‚Äù McGurn said. ‚ÄúThese are the people who want things mentioned, and getting departments to boil down their priorities was always a challenge.‚Äù While any one line in a State of the Union speech may not seem to be a matter of critical importance, Bush‚Äôs 2003 speech ‚Äî and the brouhaha that resulted from the inclusion of the now-infamous ‚Äú16 words‚Äù alleging that Saddam Hussein had sought to purchase uranium from Niger ‚Äî is a reminder of the consequences that even a single sentence can have. Interest groups say they pursue a scattershot strategy as they lobby to get their issues in the speech. ‚ÄúWhat we try to do is get our priorities in front of as many people as possible so that you start creating some kind of echo effect,‚Äù said Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO). Depending on the focus of the organization, the typical channels might include the Office of Public Engagement, the Domestic Policy Council or the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, as well as Cabinet secretaries and departments dedicated to specific issues, such as the Council on Environmental Quality and the Council of Economic Advisers. This year, while the process is much the same as it has been in the past, some of those involved in lobbying the White House say their bar for success is higher than it has been for previous speeches. Whereas in recent years a vague mention of a policy goal might have been viewed as a win, this time, as President Obama embarks on a second term and as Congress remains gridlocked, some interest groups are hoping that the White House will bypass Capitol Hill and take executive action. ‚ÄúIn the past you might be hoping for him to say the word ‚Äòclimate‚Äô ‚Äî that‚Äôs such a big accomplishment,‚Äù said Melinda Pierce, legislative director of the Sierra Club. ‚ÄúWe have much bigger hopes this year. . . . I think the question coming out of [the inauguration] was, what can the president do given that Congress isn‚Äôt delivering at all?‚Äù ‚ÄúObviously, we have answers to that,‚Äù she added. When it comes to the potential courses of action for the White House, many advocacy organizations have made clear that they have specific moves in mind. Human Rights Campaign, the country‚Äôs largest gay rights group, is pressing for an executive order granting nondiscrimination protections to employees of federal contractors. Among the items on an eight-page policy wish list sent by NALEO to the White House last month are legislative progress on immigration and the creation of a White House Office of New Americans.\n",

      "Doc:  Group prays on Capitol Hill in support of immigration reform Wednesday, February 13, 2013 12:01:00 GMT-05:00 A circle of people gathered around a makeshift outdoor altar on Capitol Hill early Wednesday, praying that senators at a hearing nearby would reform a failed immigration system that they said has caused millions of people to face ‚Äúconstant fear of deportation‚Äù and spend years ‚Äúliving in the shadows.‚Äù About 20 participants observed Ash Wednesday as clergymen smeared ashes on their foreheads, and the service invoked Christian values and metaphors in calling for compassion and welcome to all immigrants. One hymn asked God‚Äôs help to ‚Äúshatter the wall of fear and help us build a bridge of hope.‚Äù A prayer said that Jesus had ‚Äúcrossed every border between divinity and humanity to make your home with us.‚Äù The gathering outside the United Methodist Building, organized by Church World Service, was held just before the Senate Judiciary Committee opened the first of several hearings on proposals for comprehensive immigration reform that have been produced by a bipartisan Senate group. The Senate panel has called for a path to legalization for the country‚Äôs estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, echoing proposals by President Obama. Clergymen, participants and speakers at the outdoor service said they strongly endorsed this proposal. Josue Aguiluz, 21, a Honduran student from Colesville, Md., told the group that he and his family had come to the United States without authorization years ago to help pay for medical bills and to give him and his siblings a better life. He said he had won a reprieve from deportation last year under Obama‚Äôs new policy on some illegal immigrant youths known as ‚Äúdreamers.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am a dreamer. My mother left everything behind to give us a chance to fulfill our dreams, so she is a dreamer too,‚Äù said Aguiluz, who is studying to become an accountant at Montgomery Community College. ‚ÄúIt is unfair and un-Christian for someone like her to be excluded from our country. Every immigrant is a human, and every immigrant will be a dreamer.‚Äù The Rev. Jacek Orzechowski, a member of the Franciscan Action Network, called on Congress to ‚Äúfind the political will to pass common-sense immigration reform,‚Äù and asked American leaders to see immigrants through God‚Äôs eyes, ‚Äúnot as a threat, but as a blessing‚Äù to the nation. After the service, he and the others walked to the Hart Senate Office Building to attend the hearing.\n",

      "Doc:  Is the Voting Rights Act in trouble? Wednesday, February 27, 2013 12:53:41 GMT-05:00 Judging by all the early reporting on the first round of Supreme Court arguments about a key section of the Voting Rights Act, that provision may be in real peril. Conservative justices expressed sharp skepticism of the law, with much attention being paid to Antonin Scalia‚Äôs description of it as a ‚Äúperpetuation of racial entitlement.‚Äù Scalia also said that members of Congress can‚Äôt be trusted to do the right thing about the law, because it is popular: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to lose votes if they vote against the Voting Rights Act. Even the name is wonderful.‚Äù This is a curious attitude towards democracy ‚Äî it‚Äôs automatically suspect if members of Congress support laws favored by their constituents? And John Roberts actually asked this: ‚ÄúIs it the government‚Äôs submission that citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?‚Äù That aside, all may not be lost. That‚Äôs because proponents of the Voting Rights Act are focused mainly on holding on to Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy‚Äôs comments were skeptical of the Act, too, but his line of questioning left room for him to uphold the law, according to Myrna Perez, a senior counsel with the Brennan Center, who was at the court today and spoke to me by phone. Kennedy‚Äôs main objection to the law, she noted, was that it constitutes ‚Äúreverse engineering.‚Äù He also suggested that times have changed since it was enacted. The question is whether Kennedy‚Äôs line of questioning pinpointed anything in particular that would justify labeling the law unconstitutional. Proponents are hoping Kennedy will make the call based on very specific criteria: First, whether or not Congress, in passing the law and renewing it in 2006, carefully evaluated whether the conclusions it reached ‚Äî about the states and localities that require federal ‚Äúpre-clearance‚Äù before changing voting laws ‚Äî are reasonable. And second, whether the remedy Congress picked (Section 5) was within the proper scope of Congress‚Äô power. When Congress renewed the law in 2006, proponents note that it undertook very careful review to determine whether the evidence still justifies pre-clearance. Last May, a federal appeals court upheld the law on the grounds that Congress had indeed reached reasonable conclusions about the need for pre-clearance in these states and localities, and declared that the remedy Congress took was within its powers. There is nothing specific in Kennedy‚Äôs questioning that necessarily means he‚Äôll disagree, Perez noted. She said that Kennedy‚Äôs objection to ‚Äúreverse engineering‚Äù doesn‚Äôt go to the core question of whether the law passes those two basic tests. ‚ÄúKennedy asked hard questions ‚Äî that‚Äôs his job,‚Äù Perez says. ‚ÄúBut the questions didn‚Äôt signal the law‚Äôs demise.‚Äù Scalia and Roberts obviously appear to be leaning in favor of striking down the provision. But perhaps the law isn‚Äôt toast just yet. **************************************************** UPDATE: SCOTUSblog seems to reach a similar conclusion, i.e., that it‚Äôs not clear yet that the law is in serious trouble, and also focuses on another key Kennedy phrase: ‚Äútrusteeship of the United States government.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  Montgomery County loses collective bargaining appeal Tuesday, March 5, 2013 06:57:00 GMT-05:00 Montgomery County lost a trio of key collective bargaining cases Monday, as the state Court of Special Appeals ruled that County Executive Isiah Leggett acted improperly two years ago when he refused to fully fund salary increases awarded to county unions by independent arbitrators. The court did not order the county to retroactively pay the raises to police, firefighters and other county employees, who sued in 2011. Leggett had argued that he was not bound by the county charter provision that requires binding arbitration in labor negotiations that reach impasse. A county circuit court ruled in Leggett‚Äôs favor, and unions appealed. But the cases have had an impact on the FY 2014 budget Leggett will introduce next week. It will include significant salary hikes for union members--the first in four years--which Leggett said he negotiated because of the possibility that the county would ultimately lose its argument about arbitration in the courts, leaving taxpayers on the hook for much larger arbitrated payments. The county can ask the Court of Appeals, the state‚Äôs highest court, to review the cases.\n",

      "Doc:  In India, Syrian regime courts BRIC countries Friday, March 8, 2013 14:05:43 GMT-05:00 The bloc of the five emerging economies called BRICS may have lost some of its sheen recently, but it is being wooed as an important lobbying group by the besieged Syrian government. During her three-day visit to India, senior Syrian minister Bouthaina Shaaban asked New Delhi to take the lead in drafting a strong statement in support of Syria, when the five nations -- comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- meet at a conference later this month. Shaaban said she had handed Indian officials a letter from the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad addressed to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The letter, she said, asked India to call for a peaceful resolution that did not impinge on Syria‚Äôs sovereignty. ‚ÄúWe want India, Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa to make a very strong decision to support a political solution in Syria, to support the right of the Syrian people to decide a future for themselves,‚Äù Shaaban, the political and media advisor to Assad, told reporters in New Delhi on Friday. Shaabansaid that the armed anti-government rebels were religious fundamentalists, and criticized Western nations for supporting the fighters. ‚ÄúThank God, there are countries like the BRICS‚Ä¶ to introduce reason into what is happening in the international community,‚Äù Shabaan said. ‚ÄúOtherwise we would have faced what Libya is facing today. BRICS have been taking a very honest and very balanced stance.‚Äù In the past two years, Syria has been rocked by a bloody revolt that has killed tens of thousands of people. China and Russia have opposed moves by the the United States and other western nations to impose sanctions to pressure the Syrian government. Last year, the BRICS nations called for an end to the rhetoric of military action against Syria. India has until now walked the tightrope between the United States and Syria. It voted in favor of sanctions, but later abstained from another vote in the United Nations General Assembly, saying it opposed acts that aimed at change of regime in Syria. On Wednesday, India‚Äôs foreign office expressed its ‚Äúdeep concern on the security situation in Syria‚Äù and said that the Geneva Communique, which had called for respecting Syria‚Äôs sovereignty, must form the basis for a solution. On Friday, Shaaban also urged reporters to use the term ‚Äúinternational community‚Äù with caution. ‚ÄúThe BRICS is also a big part of the international community, so please stop using the term when you are referring to Western forces,‚Äù Shaaban said. Then she added, ‚ÄúIt is very difficult to counter Western narrative.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  Leukemia treatment shows good results in a handful of patients Wednesday, March 20, 2013 19:54:39 GMT-05:00 A leukemia therapy in which a patient‚Äôs lymphocytes are genetically modified to attack the tumor cells causing the disease has shown dramatic effects in five patients, according to a new study. The treatment appeared to eliminate cancer cells that had grown back after initially being beaten down by chemotherapy. Patients were then able to undergo bone marrow transplants, a grueling but sometimes curative procedure. Might the ‚Äúimmunotherapy‚Äù have been curative on its own? That‚Äôs the biggest of several unanswered questions. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm banking on it,‚Äù said Renier J. Brentjens, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study reported in Science Translational Medicine. ‚ÄúMy goal is to remove bone marrow transplant as a requirement to treat this disease.‚Äù The four people had B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood cancer in which fewer than one-third of patients survive five years. All had gotten conventional chemotherapy, gone into temporary remission and then relapsed. ‚ÄúThese patients have what we term virtually terminal illness, with survival measured in months,‚Äù Brentjens said. In the experimental treatment, immune system cells called T lymphocytes were filtered from the bloodstream of each patient. Using a virus to deliver the gene, the cells were then genetically altered so they carried on their surfaces a molecular receptor allowing them to attach to the leukemia cells. The lymphocytes were then infused back into the bloodstream. They homed in on the cancer cells and killed them. They also replicated, making more of themselves. In two patients, the effects were especially notable. Before the treatment, more than 60 percent of the cells in their bone marrow, where leukemia originates, were cancer cells. Eight days after the treatment, no cancer cells were seen under the microscope. Within two months, even the most sensitive molecular search couldn‚Äôt find any. Those two patients had a stormy course, however. In the process of killing billions of leukemia cells, the infused lymphocytes released a storm of hormones called cytokines, causing fever, blood pressure instability and other problems. Both patients spent time in intensive care. The plan all along was to have the patients undergo bone marrow transplants. Four of the five patients in the study did. One subsequently died of a blood clot in the lungs. The other three are alive, five to 24 months after their immunotherapy. ‚ÄúThe obvious question is what would have happened if we did not give them a bone marrow transplant? Would we have cured them with the T cells alone? We don‚Äôt know the answer to that,‚Äù Brentjens said. The experience of another patient, a 59-year-old man, suggests the treatment isn‚Äôt curative. He had such a severe ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù that the physicians gave him high-dose steroids to suppress his immune system. His cancer returned in three months. By that time, he was too ill for a bone marrow transplant and died. Steroids can kill T lymphocytes. They might have done so to the engineered lymphocytes before they had finished their work. Or perhaps those cells are able to only suppress the leukemia cells, not destroy them. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the National Cancer Institute have used a similar strategy against a form of lymphoma and another type of leukemia. Brentjens said the task now is to learn whether it is better used early in treatment ‚Äî perhaps between rounds of chemotherapy ‚Äî or with multiple infusions later on if traditional treatment fails.\n",

      "Doc:  Chinese military denies damaging Vietnamese boat in clash Wednesday, March 27, 2013 07:38:00 GMT-05:00 BEIJING ‚Äî After a week of acrimonious accusations between China and Vietnam, the Chinese military has admitted that one of its ships fired at a Vietnamese fishing boat, although it insisted that only flares were shot and that Vietnam‚Äôs claims of fire damage to the fishing boat were a ‚Äúsheer fabrication.‚Äù The altercation and angry rhetoric are just the latest in a string of maritime clashes over territory between China and many of its neighbors. But at their worst, such run-ins have consisted of boats ramming each other, the use of water cannons and the arrests of fishermen, and they have rarely escalated to the firing of shots. The clash and the prolonged trading of barbs for days afterward point to a worsening rift between the two communist countries. Vietnamese leaders say the fishing boat was near the disputed Paracel Islands on March 20 when the Chinese vessel began to chase it. The crew of the Vietnamese boat told local news media that the Chinese ship fired at their boat four to five times and set its cabin ablaze. Vietnamese officials called the incident serious and life-threatening. Vietnam lodged a complaint with the Chinese Embassy in Hanoi and insisted that China pay reparations to the fishermen. After a week of silence, China‚Äôs Defense Ministry posted a statement late Tuesday on its Web site justifying the Chinese actions. The ministry said that the Vietnamese boats ‚Äúillegally‚Äù entered Chinese waters and that a Chinese patrol vessel tried to warn the fishing boat with whistles, shouts and hand-flag signals. When those failed, the Chinese naval crew fired two red flares, both of which burned out in the air, the ministry said. In its statement, the Chinese military also portrayed itself as a model of restraint. It said that since last year, at least 303 Vietnamese fishing boats have entered the disputed waters but that China has refrained from capturing such boats ‚Äúout of concerns of maintaining military relations.‚Äù Vietnam is just one of many countries now feuding with China. The tensions have escalated as China‚Äôs military has grown stronger and Chinese leaders have asserted their claims more boldly. In the South China Sea, where the clash with Vietnam took place, China is vying with six other sovereign states. Of them all, China has laid claim to the largest portion ‚Äî virtually the entire sea. The region is believed to hold much untapped oil and natural gas ‚Äî energy resources that China is desperate to acquire to continue fueling its economic growth. The clashes resulting from its stance have been especially fierce with the Philippines, which claims islands off its coasts, notably the Spratlys and Scarborough Shoal. At the same time, Beijing‚Äôs dispute with Tokyo over maritime territories to China‚Äôs east has also heated up. In the latest skirmish, Japanese officials said a Chinese naval vessel locked a weapons-guiding radar onto a Japanese ship in the disputed area. Beijing denied the accusation. The United States has moved carefully to support longtime allies such as Japan and the Philippines, as well as regional partners such as Vietnam, without offending China. Even as the clashes have increased neighbors‚Äô perceptions of China as a threat, Beijing has signaled recently that it will maintain its more aggressive stance. ‚ÄúFor a long time, China was restrained and conciliatory in the territory disputes with neighbor countries. Some countries took this to mean China was weak and could be bullied anytime,‚Äù Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, executive director of the China Military Science Society, said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúChina tries to use peaceful measures to resolve the disputes. But if all the diplomatic measures and the administrative measures don‚Äôt work, China will take military measures.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  Fairfax County schools could face shortage of mental-health clinicians Friday, March 29, 2013 18:31:57 GMT-05:00 A multimillion-dollar budget crunch in Fairfax County schools next year might force an unsustainable workload on the mental-health clinicians who help students cope with stress, anxiety and emotional crises, administrators said. The December mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ‚Äî and other recent high-profile attacks involving shooters with mental illnesses ‚Äî renewed public focus on mental health and started a national conversation about the role of school psychologists and social workers in students‚Äô lives. This year, several bills were introduced in Congress addressing a shortage of mental-health professionals in schools. Fairfax County could face a similar shortage, school officials said, if additional funding is not included in next year‚Äôs budget to hire more mental-health professionals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a challenge to meet all the needs of our kids,‚Äù said Amy Parmentier, coordinator of social-work services in Fairfax schools. ‚ÄúNewtown has certainly tragically punctuated it. There‚Äôs more to educating children than just academics.‚Äù This year, the ratio in Fairfax schools is one psychologist and one social worker per 2,200 ¬≠general-education students. Most high schools, which average between 2,400 and 2,700 students, have only one school psychologist and one social worker. Fairfax staffing levels are far below national standards. The National Association for School Psychologists recommends one school psychologist per 500 students. The School Social Workers Association of America recommends one social worker with a master‚Äôs degree per 400 students. The ratio in Fairfax worsened during the recession, when the school system eliminated social worker and psychologist positions to save money while student enrollment continued to balloon. ‚ÄúI would never say we have enough‚Äù mental-health professionals, said Dede Bailer, who coordinates psychology services for the Fairfax schools. ‚ÄúIt would be wonderful if we had additional staffing. But we don‚Äôt have the same number of positions that we had 10 years ago, and since then our population has increased.‚Äù Kim Dockery, assistant superintendent for special services, said that social workers and psychologists can be the first line of defense in schools, helping to do proactive screenings to address students‚Äô issues before they are manifested in bigger problems. But since most clinicians have such a high workload, they are often acting more like a last resort, attending to students who are in crisis. Crucial prevention work rarely happens, clinicians said. Clinicians said they tackle a variety of issues, including depression, anxiety, bullying, substance and alcohol abuse, family deaths and parents‚Äô divorces. Often, the clinicians are the only people students feel they can talk to openly about very personal concerns. Nikki Simmons, the mother of an 18-year-old former Fairfax student, credits the school system‚Äôs clinicians with helping to save her daughter‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúThey really helped her get out of her bad times,‚Äù said Simmons. ‚ÄúIt was hell and back.‚Äù Simmons said that funding for more mental-health professionals is crucial and described Fairfax‚Äôs clinicians as among the best in the region. She said her daughter began having mood swings during her freshman year. She started using drugs, drinking alcohol and cutting herself. The girl had thoughts of suicide. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about an honor roll student to D‚Äôs and F‚Äôs in a matter of months,‚Äù Simmons said. As a sophomore at Woodson High, her daughter met with Fairfax clinicians for about 30 minutes a day. Her dark moods began to lighten. ‚ÄúShe always had someone to go to whenever there was something wrong,‚Äù Simmons said. Fairfax school psychologists said the county‚Äôs increase in students directly correlates with an increase in need for mental-health services. In a 2011 survey, almost 30 percent of Fairfax students reported feeling symptoms of depression, and 16 percent said they had considered suicide during the previous year.\n",

      "Doc:  A bog yields evidence of massacre during the time of Christ Monday, April 1, 2013 16:00:18 GMT-05:00 In the days of ancient Rome, it was never a good idea to send amateurs to pacify the Germanic tribes. The Emperor Augustus found this out in A.D. 9, when his handpicked crony, Varus, blundered into a series of ambushes in the Teutoburg Forest and lost about 20,000 men in three days. Several years later, another Roman army stopped at that battlefield, a bit south of the modern German city of Bremen, to clean up the scene. According to the historian Tacitus, they found ‚Äúbleaching bones, scattered or in little heaps,‚Äù while ‚Äúhard by lay splintered spears and limbs of horses.‚Äù Human skulls ‚Äúwere nailed prominently on the tree-trunks.‚Äù There were ‚Äúgibbets and torture pits for the prisoners,‚Äù and ‚Äúin the neighboring groves stood the savage altars at which they [the Germanic tribes] had slaughtered the tribunes and chief centurions.‚Äù Varus had fallen on his sword after the battle, either out of shame or because he was terrified. It was impossible to know which. Scattered archaeological evidence has long suggested that the warriors of ancient Germania were not kind-hearted in victory. But new evidence suggests just how grisly things were at about the time of Christ, when an aggressive and well-organized young Roman empire was trying ‚Äî ultimately, unsuccessfully ‚Äî to subdue the equally aggressive inhabitants of Germania. A Danish team, working in a bog about 325 miles north of the site of the Roman massacre, is analyzing the recently excavated remains of 40 men, part of a larger contingent of as many as 200 soldiers, whose bodies were apparently hacked to bits and thrown into the shallows of Lake Mosso after a battle that took place between German rivals, probably a few years before the Varus massacre. The Alken bog, lying today beneath a lakeside meadow, conceals the largest concentration of apparent war dead ever found from that era. These findings, added to artifacts from other sites and the writings of the ancient Romans, are supplying insights into a warlord culture of fiercely egalitarian German tribes that fought constantly, routinely slaughtered their enemies and offered their bodies ‚Äî and their weapons ‚Äî to their gods. The remains in the bog ‚Äúare all young males,‚Äù said Aarhus University archaeologist Mads Holst, leader of the excavation team from the university and Denmark‚Äôs Skanderborg and Moesgard museums. ‚ÄúThere is quite a lot of weapon damage on them, and none of the wounds were healed. Some were dead already when they were thrown into the lake, and we can see there were animals gnawing on the bones. One of the things we are investigating now is whether they all died of battle wounds, or were executed after the battle. We suspect both.‚Äù Holst said Danes have been digging peat and finding bones and artifacts at the Alken Bog, which is located in present-day Denmark, for at least a century. Peat is compressed plant material used as fuel in stoves and fireplaces. Because it is wet and oxygen-free, it provides ideal conditions for preserving human remains. Archaeologists in the 1950s and early 1960s found a large concentration of human bones preserved below the water table, but Holst said scientists ignored the find at first because of the spectacular discovery nearby of an enormous deposit of Roman weapons. These dated to A.D. 200, but other artifacts at that site, known as Illerup, suggested that the weapons‚Äô owners were invaders from Scandinavia who carried Roman equipment. Illerup, Holst said, ‚Äútells you something about arms trafficking at the time.‚Äù The Alken bog dead, by contrast, were buried with typically German iron axes, spears and wooden clubs. They were Germans with German weapons.\n",

      "Doc:  Third death in China from new bird flu strain Wednesday, April 3, 2013 10:37:00 GMT-05:00 BEIJING ‚Äî Chinese authorities tried to calm spreading health concerns Wednesday after a third person was reported to have died from a new type of bird flu. The emergence in China of the H7N9 strain of avian flu ‚Äî a total of nine cases have been reported since it was revealed last weekend ‚Äî are troubling because the strain has not previously been found in humans. Even as two new cases were announced Wednesday, China‚Äôs state media sought to reassure the public that the chances of contracting H7N9 remain low. They also said that testing kits developed for the strain have been distributed to the national flu-monitoring network. Nothing so far, authorities stressed, suggests that the strain can be transmitted from one human to another. The World Health Organization also urged calm this week but noted the importance of determining how the virus came to infect humans and whether it might spread. Just one patient so far appeared to have had direct contact with poultry. Dozens of people who came into contact with each patient are being monitored, authorities said. A different strain of bird flu, H5N1, that emerged in 2003 has killed more than 370 people, according to the WHO. Local media on Wednesday described the latest fatality as a 38-year-old chef in the eastern province of Zhejiang. A second patient from the same area was described as a 67-year-old retiree who was being treated in a hospital. Authorities revealed over the weekend that two other men had died in Shanghai. Shanghai officials appeared particularly eager to dispel rumors that the new avian flu strain was related to the recent scandal triggered by the discovery of more than 15,000 dead pigs in Shanghai-area rivers. Public statements released Wednesday were aimed at assuring citizens that poultry and pork supplies in the city remain safe to eat. The Shanghai Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center tested 34 samples from pig carcases and reported finding no traces of bird flu, state media reported. Many city residents, however, remain skeptical. This week, Vietnam enacted a ban on all poultry products from China, stepping up border controls, while Taiwan put officials on alert and set up a monitoring group as a precaution against an epidemic-level outbreak. Some experts have deemed China a higher risk for bird flu given the sheer size of its poultry industry and its use of production methods that put farmers in closer proximity to their chickens. In their media and public-health response, Chinese authorities have been haunted by the specter of past medical crises, most notably the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003, when official censorship and tight control of information worsened matters. But Zhong Nanshan, director of the Chinese Medical Association, told Chinese media it is considered very unlikely that this bird flu strain will turn into a problem on the scale of SARS.\n",

      "Doc:  Heavy documentation of Boston Marathon is an asset to investigation Tuesday, April 16, 2013 11:16:00 GMT-05:00 For all the horror of the Monday bombings in central Boston, investigators have been blessed with at least one advantage: a rich stream of possible evidence drawn not only from surveillance cameras but from personal photos and video footage, as well as cellphone records. Authorities on Tuesday said that they planned to sift through footage from surveillance cameras near Boston‚Äôs Copley Square and that police had been assigned to review surveillance tapes from nearby businesses. The commissioner of the Boston Police, Ed Davis, vowed officials would go ‚Äúthrough every frame of every video‚Äù taken during Monday‚Äôs Boston Marathon. ‚ÄúThis is probably one of the most photographed areas in the country yesterday,‚Äù Davis told reporters. Investigators said they had already received a huge volume of tips, but appealed to the public to share any amateur photos or videos they might provide clues. Officials have said they do not have any suspects. ‚ÄúThere have to be hundreds if not thousands of photographs or videos or observations that were made down at that finish line yesterday,‚Äù said Col. Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police. ‚ÄúI would encourage you to bring forward anything,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou might not think it‚Äôs significant, but it might have some value to this investigation.‚Äù A federal law enforcement official said the FBI is also checking cellphone activity on towers near the scene of the blasts. Experts say that data could be particularly useful if the explosives were detonated by phone, especially since they know the exact time the blast occurred. ‚ÄúGet a dump for the closest tower and look for all calls or texts terminating at the bomb site from 2:49 to 2:50 p.m.,‚Äù said Michael Sussmann, a former federal prosecutor who now represents wireless providers as a partner at Perkins Coie law firm in Washington. ‚ÄúIf there are many, it will be a one to five second call, so look for short calls. Then correlate with the other blast site and see if the incoming number at the time of the second blast matches.‚Äù If the tower data yield suspect numbers, investigators can obtain from the phone company subscriber information giving name, address and billing information. If the phone was a disposable model, it‚Äôs possible to learn where the phone was purchased. Surveillance cameras near the point of sale could provide further clues, some former federal prosecutors said. If the bomber used two different cell phones, then that makes tracking them back more difficult. In general, cell tower data will be more useful once investigators have a lead on a suspect. But collecting that data now makes sense to have it on hand to sift through later, officials said. Each clue is a piece to a jigsaw puzzle, and the tower records may have that piece that later helps the picture become clear.\n",

      "Doc:  Episcopal Church wins Virginia Supreme Court ruling Thursday, April 18, 2013 12:47:00 GMT-05:00 The Virginia Supreme Court ruled for the Episcopal Church on Thursday in a bitter, multi¬≠million-dollar property dispute with a conservative congregation that had left the denomination amid controversies over homosexuality and other issues. The panel affirmed a lower court‚Äôs decision that the 3,000-member congregation, which voted in 2006 to leave the Episcopal Church, did not have the right to keep the sprawling property known as the Falls Church. The Falls Church property is one of the country‚Äôs largest Episcopal churches and is a central landmark in downtown Falls Church. The breakaway congregation, now called the Falls Church Anglican, has been worshiping in the Bishop O‚ÄôConnell High School auditorium in Arlington County while it sought to overturn the Fairfax County Circuit Court decision from last year. On Thursday, the Supreme Court affirmed that the property was rightly given to the mainline denomination but said some of the nearly $3 million in church coffers belongs to the Falls Church Anglican congregation. It was not immediately clear whether there would be an appeal by either side. If there is not, this would end a property dispute that drew global attention starting in 2006 when more than a dozen Virginia congregations voted to leave the Episcopal Church but keep the church properties, arguing that the denomination had ‚Äúleft‚Äù by becoming more liberal on homosexuality, the role of women and how God views non-Christians. Similar disputes have roiled Episcopal churches around the country and other parts of mainline Christianity, not only on questions of gay equality but also on more secular issues related to property rights. The Virginia dispute also became an issue in global Anglicanism ‚Äî of which the Episcopal Church is part ‚Äî when one of the breakaway leaders was disinvited to a global Anglican meeting. Even after their votes, the conservative congregations have remained part of Anglicanism by being taken in by more like-minded Anglican bodies in Africa. They have since formed a U.S. wing that they hope will become a separate Anglican branch like the Episcopal Church. After the Fairfax County Circuit Court decision, the Episcopal Church and its Virginia Diocese reached agreements with six other congregations involved in the court case to divvy up money and property. Only the Falls Church pursued an appeal. George Ward, senior warden for the Falls Church Anglican, said that his community was disappointed by the ruling but that it is ‚Äúthriving.‚Äù The Anglican group in the auditorium is far larger than the Episcopal group that won the sprawling property; about 200 Episcopalians come on a typical Sunday, said its rector, the Rev. John Ohmer. The Rev. Shannon Johnston, the Episcopal bishop of Virginia, said the diocese was ‚Äúgrateful.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis decision ensures that Episcopalians will have a home for years to come in Falls Church, and frees all of us, on both sides of this issue, to preach the Gospel and teach the faith unencumbered by this dispute,‚Äù he said in a statement.\n",

      "Doc:  Finally, D.C. Nordstrom Rack offers aid for office fashion emergencies ‚Äî sort of Thursday, April 25, 2013 19:42:00 GMT-05:00 The Nordstrom Rack on 18th and L streets NW launched last week, and the heavens opened and the angels sang and there were 300 people waiting in line ‚Äî some of whom arrived at 5:30 in the morning ‚Äî for the 9 a.m. opening, because now there was a place to buy pantyhose. Emergency pantyhose. The ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a giant run on my knee‚Äù replacement-pantyhose. The store also sells ‚ÄúI spilled coffee on my other sweater‚Äù sweaters, ‚ÄúI forgot today was my performance review‚Äù blazers, and ‚ÄúWhy did no one tell me this shirt was see-through?‚Äù bras. Artifacts, all of them, of the perilous expedition known as the Urgent Lunchtime Shop (ULS). At noon on a weekday afternoon, a week after the grand opening, the store ‚Äî which used to be a Borders, but that‚Äôs a lament for another time ‚Äî was still bums-to-tums customers, shambling through the metal racks and grayish carpet squares that define such stores. Near the checkout line, a beaming employee herds women toward open registers; there is a frenzied, dazed quality to the air. ‚ÄúThere really hasn‚Äôt been anywhere,‚Äù says Pam Davis, perusing the store with her friend. ‚ÄúNot since Filene‚Äôs.‚Äù ‚ÄúFilene‚Äôs,‚Äù her friend Tina Spellman sighs. ‚ÄúPeople,‚Äù Davis explains, ‚Äúare still in recovery over Filene‚Äôs.‚Äù Filene‚Äôs Basement was located a few blocks away, on Connecticut Avenue, before closing in 2011. Filene‚Äôs used to be the ULS run-to location in the Farragut Zip code. Its absence has required office workers in the neighborhood to make desperate calculations: 1. Risk the selection at the nearby Gap, or 2. Risk the commute to the Macy‚Äôs at Metro Center, a daring distance to complete in a lunch hour. Today, Spellman and Davis are seeking a white blouse. A particular white blouse. ‚ÄúI saw it through the window before the store opened,‚Äù Spellman says. But she is not sure if it‚Äôs still here. This is the trouble with a store like Nordstrom Rack, whose name brings to mind a specific and cruel torture device: She spent too much. Put her on the Nordstrom Rack. The chain ‚Äî a discount alternative to the regular department store ‚Äî has a whole ad campaign built around the fact that women might enter the store and spend the next 24 to 36 hours of their lives stalking the particular white blouse: ‚ÄúHappy Style Hunting,‚Äù signs say. ‚ÄúThis one?‚Äù Davis shows her friend a white blouse. No. Not that one. Places like Nordstrom Rack never have exactly what one is looking for on one‚Äôs lunch hour. Or they do, but in the wrong size. Or they do, but in the wrong color. Useful black pumps are an endangered species here at the Rack ‚Äî Happy Hunting! ‚Äî but there are an abundance of pastel espadrille wedges, and one shoe that appears to be half snakeskin, half wicker chair. Shopping at a place like this on one‚Äôs lunch hour requires convincing oneself that snakeskin/chair shoes will absolutely work for the last-minute afternoon presentation that prompted the shopping expedition to begin with. It is the land of good-enough. (Scene: A woman in a T-shirt runs into Nordstrom Rack, paws frantically through several racks and emerges with what appears to be a coral-colored blouse and an olive blazer. Would you like those in a bag? the helpful cashier offers. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the woman shakes her head. She needs them now.) ‚ÄúThese are a bunch of fun shirts I have literally no purpose for,‚Äù says Laura Payne cheerfully, brandishing the armful of clothing that she has found herself carrying around. ‚ÄúAnd these are jeans that are not the ones I was looking for,‚Äù says her friend Ashley Schmidt, who had hoped for a certain brand but is making do with another brand.\n",

      "Doc:  New Zealand may declare a war on cats Wednesday, May 15, 2013 09:34:03 GMT-05:00 Environmentalists in peaceful, pacifist New Zealand are going to war against cats, launching a plan to end feline presence on their island-chain nation once and for all. Both pets and strays, they warn, are threatening the country's delicate and famously beautiful ecosystem. The Washington Post's Karla Adams reports from the front lines: The New Zealand government is taking the proposal seriously enough that they commissioned a study to estimate its cost: $20 billion. Morgan and other environmentalists backing the controversial plan point out that New Zealand's fauna developed in the absence of cats or other large-mammal predators. Flightless birds such as the kiwi, a national symbol, are being devastated by the newly arrived cats, as are flighted birds. New Zealanders, Adams's story makes clear, really, really love birds, so they might be unusually receptive to giving up their cats. There's some precedent for this sort of effort: The country spent half a million dollars over two years to eradicate possums from a small New Zealand island. Morgan is pushing for a sort of pilot program on Stewart Island, population 402, to create a cat-free zone. Although current cat owners wouldn't have to give up their pets, they would be forbidden from replacing them. Current cat owners would also have to neuter the animals and keep them indoors or leashed (have you ever tried to put a cat on a leash?) at all times. It's not clear what would happen to strays, but one imagines it's unpleasant. For the moment, though, the plan is just hypothetical. New Zealand is not yet at war with cats.\n",

      "Doc:  Man charged with car fire, shooting building Monday, May 20, 2013 15:36:27 GMT-05:00 An Alexandria man is facing multiple charges for allegedly torching a sedan and firing shots at an unoccupied office building in Fairfax County on Saturday night, police said. Officers and firefighters found a Toyota Camry fully engulfed in flames around 11:20 p.m. Saturday in the 5500 block of Cherokee Avenue in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County, police said. A handgun and a gas can were discovered near the vehicle and it appeared shots had been fired both at the office building and within the building, Fairfax County police said. Police declined to name the office building or give its exact address. No one was injured. Matthew Mehar, 30, was quickly developed as a suspect and was arrested. He was charged with shooting in public, arson, entering an alarmed building, damage to public property and use of a firearm in commission of a felony, police said. Police declined to give a motive for the incident.\n",

      "Doc:  How innovation has changed the job of an auto repair technician Sunday, May 26, 2013 14:32:00 GMT-05:00 On a warm morning in May, a group of students is huddled around a white Chrysler Cirrus parked outside the garage at the Excel Institute, a Northeast Washington job training facility that prepares participants for careers in auto repair. Their teacher is toting a $6,000 portable computer, and he‚Äôs got it plugged into the vehicle, which has been unexpectedly shutting down. Using data that the portable computer has collected from the master computer inside the car, the group is getting closer to zeroing in on the problem. The fuel pressure is good. It has 14.7 parts of air to every one part fuel, the correct amount. By process of elimination, they determine that the ignition system isn‚Äôt generating a spark. The computer helps them figure out exactly why. (Corrosion inside the distributor, it turns out, is the culprit.) ‚ÄúInstead of taking eight hours to diagnose a car, you can do it in 30 minutes,‚Äù said Eddie Cathey, an instructor at Excel. Innovations in the automotive industry have gradually transformed what it means to be an auto repair worker. As the cars on our streets have become more computerized, so, too, has the job of maintaining and fixing these vehicles. And so a trade that was once largely mechanical is today primarily technical, and therefore requires workers to be skilled computer users, strong readers and able mathematicians. For someone in the Washington area with only a high school education, it‚Äôs a job that might offer a stronger shot than most at climbing the economic ladder. In this region, Labor Department data show that the mean annual wage for auto repair technicians was $47,710 in 2012, a figure that compares favorably to mean wages for many other jobs that do not require a college education. For example, the mean wage for food service jobs in the Washington area was $24,260; for hotel clerks, $25,750. The mean wage for auto repair technicians here also exceeds the nationwide mean for these workers of $39,060. In addition to offering the prospect of higher income, experts and employers say that demand for workers in this trade is surging as aging baby boomers retire and too few diagnosticians have entered the trade to replace them. It‚Äôs not just computer-savvy diagnosticians that are in short supply. Experts say more workers are needed who can do simple maintenance work such as brake pad replacements or oil changes. As cars are built better, they are less likely to break down, and more likely to need routine upkeep. For students at Excel and others like them, auto repair training could be a gateway to a higher standard of living and greater employment stability. ** Antwane Peoples enrolled at Excel after more than seven years of service in the Navy and a stint working as a government contractor in records management and document imaging jobs. As a father of five children, he had become weary of the uncertainty surrounding the federal budget and how it might affect his job. ‚ÄúDoing the contracting work, every October 1, I was always looking over my back,‚Äù Peoples said. ‚ÄúTrying to support a family, it gets a little hectic.‚Äù And so he decided it was time for a career change. The auto repair trade, Peoples said, ‚Äújust seems like more stability.‚Äù Peoples is poised to graduate from Excel in 2014. When he completes his training, he plans to take a test that would certify him to service automotive electrical systems. With hybrid vehicles gaining popularity, he expects such skills will be in high demand. The Excel Institute, founded in 1998, prepares students to earn a variety of Automotive Service Excellence certifications, which are the industry standard for verifying one‚Äôs expertise.\n",

      "Doc:  Prince William County hopes logo will improve marketing Sunday, June 2, 2013 19:33:17 GMT-05:00 You can‚Äôt drink, surf or lace up Prince William County. But that doesn‚Äôt mean county officials can‚Äôt learn a thing or two about branding from companies such as Pepsi, Google and Nike. Prince William officials want to standardize the logos used across departments to help the county become a consistent brand, especially to companies that might want to relocate here. To that end, officials chose a dark blue square inside a light blue square and the words ‚ÄúPrince William County, Virginia.‚Äù The county paid a contractor $750 to design the logo. The county uses 22 logos across its agencies. Officials hope that the single logo will come to represent Prince William. It will not, they said, replace the county seal, which appears on the Prince William flag and other official correspondence. During a recent meeting, county spokesman Jason Grant noted that Google Chrome, Nike and Pepsi have logos that don‚Äôt physically represent anything but came to represent the strength of a brand after people become familiar with it. The logo is ‚Äúnot meant to do anything in and of itself other than to be clear and identifiable . . . and it means something down the road,‚Äù Grant said in an interview. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the type of logo we chose to go with as opposed to something that literally represents Prince William.‚Äù The logo will be used primarily for marketing. For enforcement actions, such as correspondence from the Department of Social Services, and all Board of County Supervisors correspondence, the county seal will remain in use, officials said. The design is not necessarily a done deal. Supervisor John D. Jenkins (D-Neabsco) said that county officials should not have moved forward with the logo, which has already been put on some county letterhead and used for marketing, without express permission from supervisors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I object to the use of the logo,‚Äù Jenkins said. ‚ÄúBut I object to the way this went around to getting approved.‚Äù Board Chairman Corey A. Stewart (R-At Large) said supervisors should examine the issue. ‚ÄúI think we ought to take a look at this before we start scraping [the logo] off wherever it is,‚Äù he said. Grant said county officials were following a 2010 board resolution and report that directed them to implement a marketing plan. The report charges Grant with promulgating and implementing ‚Äúa unified communications and marketing strategy.‚Äù The logo has worked well so far, said Jeffrey Kaczmarek, the county‚Äôs head of economic development. ‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs clean, crisp. It‚Äôs adaptable in a lot of different things we do,‚Äù Kaczmarek said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great, and it‚Äôs worked very well for us. We‚Äôve gotten very good feedback from those who have seen it. We think ours stands up very well against what our competitors are doing.‚Äù Supervisors plan to take up the marketing plan at their meeting Tuesday.\n",

      "Doc:  Huayuan Academy brings China to Gaithersburg students Wednesday, June 5, 2013 08:09:35 GMT-05:00 While many kids are spending their summer days at the water park or in their back yards, 40 will be immersed in Chinese language and culture at Gaithersburg Elementary School. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very essential for all students to become global citizens and be able to communicate with the world,‚Äù said Huayuan Chinese Academy President Helen Qin. The Huayuan academy holds after-school Chinese immersion classes for the Washington region. Traditionally, most of the students are of Chinese heritage and take the classes to become more familiar with its language and culture. But this summer, Huayuan will focus on teaching basic Chinese to non-Chinese-heritage students in a free course at Gaithersburg Elementary. The three-week course runs July 8 through July 26 and has spots for 40 rising second- to fifth-graders. Program organizers hope to fill 15 of the 40 spots with students from Gaithersburg elementary schools. Qin said close to 20 spaces already have been filled. The curriculum is still in development but, Qin said, the course will consist of language classes in the mornings and cultural activities and experiments in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math in the afternoons. Lessons about Chinese tea culture, martial arts and folk dancing will make up the cultural activities. Students will end their day with a review of what they have learned. Qin said teachers will help students enhance their understanding by drawing comparisons between American and Chinese cultures. The course will challenge students to learn the language through immersion. Qin said teachers will use multimedia, pictures, video and body language to aid students‚Äô learning. In addition to the summer course, students can continue their studies in a 10-week extension course in the fall, when they will meet for one hour each week. The class will be held by the Huayuan Chinese Academy in Montgomery County schools. ‚ÄúThe 10-week extension course will focus on Chinese culture to keep interest going and to have the children become lifelong learners,‚Äù Qin said. Gaithersburg Elementary School Principal Stephanie Brant said the school will form an after-school club for their students taking the summer course. The club will allow children to continue their learning but will be separate from the extension course. ‚ÄúMy hope is that students will be really excited and will continue to participate in the club,‚Äù Brant said. ‚ÄúI welcome anything that gives students an opportunity to explore another culture, another lifestyle.‚Äù The school‚Äôs central location in Montgomery and the demographics of its student body made it a good setting for the summer course. Alan Cheung, who is coordinating the program at Gaithersburg Elementary, said the course will help introduce Chinese to students who would otherwise not be exposed to the language. ‚ÄúThe intention is for students with little or no language experience to get involved and interested in learning Chinese,‚Äù Cheung said. This course is the fourth Chinese-language summer program to emerge in Maryland, and the first in Montgomery. It joins the other three ‚Äî hosted by the New Life Christian School in Frederick, Howard Community College and Longfellow Elementary School in Columbia ‚Äî as part of the National Foreign Language Center‚Äôs Startalk program at the University of Maryland. Startalk seeks to improve learning of ‚Äúcritical need‚Äù languages in grades kindergarten through 12 and college-age students, and is a component of former President George W. Bush‚Äôs National Security Language Initiative, which was established in 2006. Startalk sends out grant application invitations each September. Once all the applications are received, Startalk reviews and decides which ones will receive federal grants. When the programs are in place, Startalk performs on-site visits to ensure the program‚Äôs national practices are being performed correctly in the classrooms, said Startalk Program Director Betsy Hart. Cheung‚Äôs Gaithersburg program is one of 24 that received grants this year.\n",

      "Doc:  In Va., Tesla Motors has a showroom where it can‚Äôt make sales Monday, June 24, 2013 18:25:54 GMT-05:00 It hasn‚Äôt been a smooth ride for Tesla Motors in Virginia. Nearly two months ago, the electric vehicle manufacturer known for its six-figure price tags opened a gallery at Tysons Corner. Potential customers can check out the Model S, chat with employees and pick up a Tesla T-shirt or baseball cap. But they can‚Äôt buy a car. Virginia law prohibits car manufacturers from operating their own dealerships, partly to encourage competition and protect consumers. So the California-based company is using the Tysons Corner location as a showroom where employees are forbidden from discussing purchases. The car manufacturer has petitioned Virginia to grant it an exemption. If granted, it could set a precedent for car manufacturers looking to sell their cars in the state without the middle man. ‚ÄúThis would be opening the door,‚Äù said George Hoffer, a transportation economics professor at the University of Richmond. ‚ÄúThere would be other people, other manufacturers, especially from abroad, who would like to come in and use this business model.‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs current model revolves around selling its products not through a dealer but directly to customers, usually online, according to Diarmuid O‚ÄôConnell, Tesla‚Äôs vice president of business development. But Tesla is hitting roadblocks like the one in Virginia across the country, most recently in North Carolina, Texas, Minnesota and New York. Forty-eight states ban or limit direct sales of automobiles, according to the Chicago Tribune. In the future, Tesla may use both its own dealerships and independently owned ones, O‚ÄôConnell said, but for now the company wants to guide customers through the new technology. Chief executive Elon Musk has said he might take his case to Congress or the federal courts. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre seeing nonstop battles at the state level, rather than fight 20 different state battles, I‚Äôd rather fight one federal battle,‚Äù Musk told Automotive News in April. Tesla‚Äôs journey in Virginia began in March 2012. An exemption to the no-direct-auto-sales law can be made if the commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles finds that no independent dealer in the community is available to ‚Äúown and operate the franchise in a manner consistent with the public interest.‚Äù A hearing officer twice recommended that Tesla be allowed to operate its own dealership, despite objections from the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association. Tesla published notices, as required by law, in The Washington Post and the Washington Times in June 2012 inviting parties interested in running a franchise to attend a hearing at the DMV. None came. ‚ÄúCould Tesla have done more? Of course it could. It could have placed notices in every journal in Virginia, Washington and Maryland,‚Äù hearing officer W. James Dangoia wrote. ‚ÄúIt could have posted notices on supermarket bulletin boards and hired skywriters. But the only notice that is required is the publication of the notice that Tesla did in fact publish.‚Äù DMV Commissioner Richard Holcomb, however, declined to authorize the exemption, saying in documents that he needed more information about Tesla‚Äôs efforts to identify or solicit potential dealers. Tesla filed an appeal with the Fairfax County Circuit Court last week and is starting to reach out to Virginia legislators ahead of the next session. Over the past five years, more than 500 Tesla cars have been sold to customers in Maryland, Virginia and the District. There is a store in the District and a service center in Rockville, in addition to the Tysons Corner gallery. Tesla is also working toward applying for a license to directly sell its cars in Maryland, a spokeswoman said. The Virginia Motor Vehicle Dealer Board will discuss the Tysons Corner Tesla location at a July 8 meeting, and it has invited Tesla representatives to explain how the gallery concept works.\n",

      "Doc:  Va. gun collector squares off with Poland over rare, World War II rifle Saturday, June 29, 2013 16:08:55 GMT-05:00 Of all the weapons in his personal collection, Kristopher Gasior always cherished the wz.38M Maroszek rifle the most. The gun ‚Äî one of only a handful in the world ‚Äî came from Poland, his home country, and it was produced in the war that claimed his grandfather‚Äôs life. But Gasior was not the only one with an interest in the military artifact. The Polish government views the Maroszek as a ‚Äúgreat piece of cultural and scientific significance.‚Äù When Gasior, who had decided to sell most of his large collection, listed the weapon for sale on his Web site, Poland had U.S. federal agents seize it, arguing it had been stolen from the government during World War II. Gasior, 54, of Fredericksburg, now finds himself at the center of an international legal battle pitting him against the European nation where he grew up. At stake, those in the case say, is a part of Polish history and the right of collectors and veterans to keep relics that they brought back from faraway places. Gasior and his lawyer argue that the rifle is what is known as a ‚Äúwar trophy,‚Äù carried into the United States legally by a soldier who got it during World War II. Polish officials say that can‚Äôt be so, because war trophies are taken from enemies, and this gun was made for Polish soldiers fighting on the same side as U.S. troops. Homeland Security officials routinely seize cultural artifacts, often statues or artwork, and return them to foreign countries with some fanfare. But when four federal agents came to Gasior‚Äôs door in March ‚Äî only a week after Gasior had posted the weapon for sale on his Web site ‚Äî Gasior said he assumed they were conducting a regular inspection of his stock. Almost immediately, he said, they demanded the Maroszek rifle, and one agent circled behind him as he protested. ‚ÄúI told them they had absolutely no right to take this rifle,‚Äù Gasior said. ‚ÄúThey made me understand if I did not give them the rifle, I would go with the rifle.‚Äù Poland is ‚Äúvery protective‚Äù of pieces the government considers ‚Äúrelated to the defense of the Polish state in any way, shape or form,‚Äù said David Stefancic, a history professor at Saint Mary‚Äôs College in Notre Dame, Ind. And the Maroszek, he said, is a ‚Äúvery unique piece.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo have one in your collection, there‚Äôs a lot of bragging rights,‚Äù he said. Gasior‚Äôs case drew particular attention earlier this year in gun collector circles, when the president of the NRA wrote a commentary for the Washington Times about the case. The gun-rights group even paid to hire a lawyer for Gasior, who said he was an on-and-off member. Gasior, though, is an unlikely face for a legal showdown with Poland. In a thick Polish accent, the married father of two speaks proudly of his parents‚Äô service in the Polish Home Army and of learning to read from his family‚Äôs Polish military history books. His grandfather, he said, died defending Poland in World War II. Gasior immigrated to the U.S. in 1985, studying international relations and political science at UCLA before he moved to Virginia to work for General Electric and Ericsson, a communications company. He said he transitioned to collecting and selling antique weapons full-time as his finances allowed. Though his business inventory of weapons at one time numbered more than 2,000, Gasior said he decided recently to retire and sell any guns that required him to keep a federal firearms license. These days, he spends most of his time taking his sons fishing or riding his Honda Shadow motorcycle on the country roads near his home. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt really a case where I was looking for troubles,‚Äù Gasior said. ‚ÄúTroubles came to me, quite unexpectedly.‚Äù\n",

      "Doc:  Chinese Web giant Tencent faces obstacles in its goal for a global IM market Friday, July 5, 2013 18:52:00 GMT-05:00 BEIJING ‚Äî With Web giants such as Facebook and Twitter blocked by the government here, an entire ecosystem of home-grown companies has flourished with names that are unfamiliar to many outside China. Tencent, one of the country‚Äôs biggest tech firms, is hoping to change that with a product that is already one of the fastest-growing mobile services in the world. The company‚Äôs instant messaging product, WeChat, has amassed more than 300 million users ‚Äî nearly equivalent to the U.S. population ‚Äî in less than three years. Tencent says there are more than 70 million users across southeast Asia, India and Mexico, with 30 million of those added in just the past three months. WeChat has also expanded into Saudi Arabia recently, and there are plans to open an office in the United States. But WeChat‚Äôs Chinese origins could cause problems for the company worldwide, just as Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE have faced obstacles in the United States. Top Web services enjoy extraordinary access to the kind of user data that is coveted by national security officials. China has long been seen as especially aggressive with cyber-snooping, and recent revelations about American Internet surveillance efforts have heightened global concerns about online privacy. WeChat has already run into some resistance. India‚Äôs intelligence bureau has reportedly proposed a ban on WeChat‚Äôs services. Analysts predict a potential backlash in the United States, too. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing when WeChat dominates in China, but when WeChat becomes popular outside China, suddenly China has this access that only the U.S. had before,‚Äù said Christopher Soghoian, senior policy analyst on speech, privacy and technology for the American Civil Liberties Union. Jeremy Goldkorn, director of Danwei.com and a Chinese media expert, said the political issue of where servers that store user data are physically located is going to become more common. ‚ÄúIt seems to me many governments are going to want as much control as possible,‚Äù he said. A spokeswoman for Tencent said that ‚Äúwe have taken user data protection seriously in our product development and daily operations, and like other international peers, we comply with relevant laws in the countries where we have operations.‚Äù In mainland China, WeChat is ubiquitous, used by everyone from teenagers and their parents to Tibetan activists. It has been called the Facebook of China, but that comparison fails to convey all the things that WeChat can do. At its most basic, WeChat functions like a free text-messaging service on your phone. Beyond just texts, users can send short videos or voice messages back and forth, like a walkie-talkie. Each person can also set up a profile like the ones on Facebook. Companies can also set up WeChat profiles to connect to customers. Have a question about a computer that needs to be fixed? Send the manufacturer your exact location via your smartphone, and an employee will tell you the nearest place to get your device repaired. Tencent is already a $7 billion company, with revenue up more than 50 percent last year. Pony Ma, Tencent‚Äôs chief executive, has said he wants his company to go global. ‚ÄúSuccessful or not, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Tencent,‚Äù Ma told CBN, a Chinese financial news network. WeChat, whose rivals include the United States-based Whats¬≠App and Japanese Line messaging services, has been able to charge into new countries by using advertising that features local celebrities, including Bollywood actors and soccer players. By doing this, Tencent is showing a level of savviness about how online services must often cater to local tastes and cultural norms. If Ma succeeds, it would be a breakthrough for Chinese tech firms.\n",

      "Doc:  The bizarre story of a North Korean ship detained in the Panama Canal Tuesday, July 16, 2013 10:37:51 GMT-05:00 When Panama detained a North Korea-flagged ship on its way through the canal from Cuba, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli flew into action. A video from inside the ship shows Martinelli investigating the ship personally, poking around the hull of the Chong Chon Gang. He took to Twitter to post a photo of the ship's mysterious cargo, saying it had been hidden under bags of sugar. He referred to the hidden cargo as \"undeclared weapons.\" According to the military consulting group Jane's, the equipment appears to be RSN-75 ‚ÄòFan Song‚Äô fire control radars for SA-2 surface-to-air missiles. Martinelli then went on Panama Radio, a national station, to tell the strange story of what happened when the North Korean ship tried to move through the canal ‚Äì including a disturbing detail about the ship's captain allegedly trying to kill himself to evade capture. Here's what he said: It's not clear who was shipping the equipment to whom. North Korea's surface-to-air missiles are many but rapidly aging. They could use upgrades, but the country also often ships military technology abroad. NKNews quotes a person familiar with the incident as suggesting these may have actually been sent from North Korea. \"Previous reports by the Panel of Experts have shown that the DPRK uses intricate indirect routes for its illegal shipments,\" the source said. \"So although this shipment was coming from Cuba this does not mean that it originated there. Perhaps it was originally from the DPRK and was being shipped via Cuba in an effort to avoid detection.\" Panama has long expressed a strongly pro-American foreign policy. Here are two photos of the Chong Chon Gang, displaying its North Korean origin:\n",

      "Doc:  Fewer teens get driver‚Äôs licenses Wednesday, July 31, 2013 20:03:29 GMT-05:00 Reaching driving age doesn‚Äôt hold the magical allure it once did for teenagers, with fewer than half of them applying for a driver‚Äôs license when they reach legal age, according to a report issued Thursday by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. Only 44 percent get a license within a year, and just over half of teenagers are licensed by the time they reach 18, an age at which two-thirds of teenagers were licensed 20 years ago. The decline is attributed to a variety of factors. Some teens don‚Äôt bother because they have no access to a car; being licensed no longer holds the social status it once did for many young people; there are other ways to get where they want to go; and the cost of gas and auto insurance are too high. The AAA research comes on the heels of preliminary indications that teenage highway fatalities increased dramatically last year, particularly among 16- and 17-year-olds. Data compiled by the Governors Highway Safety Association showed a 197 percent overall jump in the first six months of 2012. The age at which states issue beginners‚Äô licenses ranges from 14 to 16, with the District allowing them at 16, Virginia at six months after the 15th birthday and Maryland at nine months after a teen turns 15. Most states have adopted graduated driver‚Äôs license (GDL) laws, which restrict teenagers during their initial years of driving. Thirty-one states ban cellphone use, among them the District, Maryland and Virginia. All three local jurisdictions and 46 other states restrict teen driving at night. All three are among the 47 states that limit the number of passengers a teen can carry during the initial months of driving. One consequence of the trend toward waiting until they‚Äôre 18 to get a license is that teenagers miss out on the restrictions that are intended to nurse them through the early months of driving. ‚ÄúWith one in three teens waiting to get their license until they turn 18, there‚Äôs a segment of this generation missing opportunities to learn under the safeguards that [graduated driver‚Äôs licensing] provides,‚Äù said Peter Kissinger, president of the nonprofit AAA foundation. ‚ÄúFor most, it‚Äôs about not having a car or having alternatives for getting around that are the top reasons cited for delaying what has traditionally been considered to be a rite of passage.‚Äù Earlier research by the AAA foundation found that states with GDL systems had experienced a 38 percent drop in fatal crashes involving 16-year-olds and a 40 percent reduction in crashes that resulted in injury. The AAA survey results showed that low-income and minority teenagers are least likely to obtain a driver‚Äôs license before age 18. In households with incomes less than $20,000, only 25 percent of teenagers obtained their license before they turned 18. By contrast, 79 percent of teens were licensed by age 18 in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. ‚ÄúIt all boils down to economics. In many parts of the country and in the Washington metro area, driver education classes in public schools, once the primary method of teaching novice drivers to drive, are relics of the past,‚Äù said AAA spokesman John B. Townsend II. ‚ÄúOne of the unintended consequences of graduated driver‚Äôs licensing laws is that teens have to enroll in private-sector driving schools to complete their driver‚Äôs education requirements to obtain a driver‚Äôs license, and that can be extremely costly and prohibitive, especially for low-income teens,‚Äù Townsend said.\n",

      "Doc:  Fairfax man charged with murder in wife‚Äôs death Saturday, August 10, 2013 22:32:39 GMT-05:00 The husband of a Fairfax County woman who was reported missing Thursday has been arrested and charged in her death, Fairfax police said. Caleb Crew, 25, was charged Saturday evening in the death of Andrea Crew, 31, who was the mother of two children, the police said. The arrest was announced hours after the discovery of a woman‚Äôs body in the Occoquan River. In their initial report of the discovery, police said only that they were trying to determine whether it was connected to Andrea Crew‚Äôs disappearance. Police had said that she was last seen about 11 a.m. Wednesday in the 5500 block of Cherokee Avenue in the Alexandria section of the county. They said Andrea Crew, who lived in the 8000 block of Gila Court, was getting out of a vehicle near a bank. It was not immediately clear what led police to charge Caleb Crew. Police said his arrest came after an extensive investigation. After Crew was taken into custody at the Mount Vernon-area police station he was taken to the county adult detention center, where a warrant was served charging him with murder, police said. Police said they were continuing ‚Äúan active, ongoing investigation.‚Äù They said they worked throughout Friday night and Saturday carrying out an extensive search of the river where the body had been found, near Interstate 95. The river forms the boundary between Fairfax and Prince William counties.\n",

      "Doc:  Leggett, Montgomery business and civic leaders to visit China Wednesday, August 28, 2013 13:19:34 GMT-05:00 Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett will visit China next month, leading a delegation of business and civic leaders looking for partnership opportunities in areas such as education and biotechnology. While final details are still being worked out, Leggett‚Äôs group is scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai, Benxi and Xi‚Äôan, the county‚Äôs newest ‚Äúsister city.‚Äù The trip, set for Sept. 15-25, has been jointly organized by the county, the Maryland China Business Council and the state of Maryland‚Äôs trade and investment office in Shanghai, which will help with roundtables and other contacts. The Chinese investment footprint in Montgomery is small, but it‚Äôs one that officials would like to expand. ‚ÄúWe are visitors from Montgomery County interested in finding the right partners and learning about market opportunities to advance business ties,‚Äù said Lily Qi, a Leggett aide for special projects. Leggett is scheduled to host a reception for the business community in Shanghai. The group will also visit the Zhangjiang biotech and pharmaceutical park, known as ‚ÄúDrug Valley.‚Äù In Benxi, a city in the northeast near the provincial capital of Shenyang, the delegation will learn about the massive medical complex planned by the central government called ‚ÄúChina Medicine Capital.‚Äù In Xi‚Äôan, one of the country‚Äôs oldest cities, Leggett will finalize the county‚Äôs newest sister city agreement to foster cultural understanding and trade. Xi‚Äôan joins Gondar, Ethiopia and Morazan, El Salvador. Xi‚Äôan No. 1 Middle School, which is actually a high school, will also partner with the county‚Äôs Winston Churchill High School in Potomac. According to a draft itinerary, some of the county delegation will attend a Beijing dinner hosted by the China Fortune Land Development, a company that invests in industrial parks and residential real estate. It won‚Äôt be all business. In Beijing, for example, the schedule includes touristy options such as ‚ÄúThe Legend of Kung Fu Show.‚Äù In Xi‚Äôan there is the ‚ÄúImperial Dumpling Dinner with Tang Dynasty Show.‚Äù A full list of the delegation is not yet available. It includes Elaine Amir, executive director of Johns Hopkins‚Äô Montgomery campus, Superintendent of Schools Joshua Starr and two County Council members, Roger Berliner (D-Potomac-Bethesda) and Hans Riemer (D-At Large). All delegation members are paying their own way, county officials said.\n",

      "Doc:  Facebook facial recognition policy draws attention from German privacy regulator Friday, August 30, 2013 16:20:55 GMT-05:00 Facebook proposed changes to two of its most important legal documents Thursday, and new language on how the networking site deals with facial recognition technology has already raised some eyebrows ‚Äî including those of a German privacy regulator, according to a report from PC World . The social network had previously run into some resistance from European regulators who wanted it to be more explicit about how it uses such technology. Following recommendations from the Irish Data Protection Commission, the company then deleted all facial recognition data from European users from its servers. After Facebook disposed of the data, the Hamburg Commission for Data Protection and Freedom of Information dropped proceedings against the company asking it to obtain explicit consent from German Facebook users before using this kind of feature. So, the PC World report notes, German privacy regulators were surprised to see mention of facial recognition technology in the German version of the proposed policy Thursday. In fact, in a statement to PC World, Hamburg privacy commissioner Johannes Caspar said he was ‚Äúastonished‚Äù to see Facebook mention the technology. Facebook declined to comment on the regulator‚Äôs statement, but spokeswoman Jodi Seth confirmed that facial recognition features are not currently being implemented in Europe. The changes in question make clear that Facebook is allowed to take users‚Äô profile pictures into account when it offers suggestions about whom your friends should tag in their photos. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, Facebook chief privacy officer Erin Egan said that she believes tagging actually improves user privacy, because it offers an automatic way for users to police which images of their faces are posted to the Web site. ‚ÄúThe benefit in being tagged is that you know photos exist,‚Äù Egan told the newspaper Thursday. Those interested in seeing the changes Facebook is planning to make to its policies can view a list of them on its Web site. Users have seven days to provide suggestions and other input to the firm before the changes become official. (Washington Post Co. chairman and chief executive Donald E. Graham is a member of Facebook‚Äôs board of directors.) Follow The Post‚Äôs new tech blog, The Switch, where technology and policy connect.\n",

      "Doc:  Hagel salutes heroism of Pentagon 9/11 responders Wednesday, September 11, 2013 15:13:09 GMT-05:00 Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on Wednesday afternoon saluted the heroism of the emergency workers, service members, Department of Defense civilians and construction workers who responded to help others in the minutes, hours and days after the Pentagon was struck by a hijacked jet 12 years ago. ‚ÄúThough time continually moves us further away from September 11, 2001, we will never forget the men and women that our Pentagon community lost that day,‚Äù Hagel said during an afternoon ceremony for Pentagon employees held in the building‚Äôs courtyard. ‚ÄúNeither will we forget the stories of those who served here on 9/11 and what they did in the days, weeks, months, and years that followed.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are stories of heroism ‚Äì of doctors who ran into the fire, to rescue, to treat people they had never known before, but felt their duty to save,‚Äù he said. More than 10,000 Pentagon employees reported to the still-burning building for work the day after the attack, ‚Äúrefusing to be beaten down by terror or intimidated by terror,‚Äù Hagel noted. Hagel also recalled the Phoenix Project that quickly rebuilt the destroyed portions of the Pentagon. ‚ÄúThey are stories of recovery and rebirth ‚Äì of men and women who worked day and night for almost an entire year to clear the rubble and make the Pentagon whole again,‚Äù he said. The courtyard event followed a morning ceremony with President Obama at the Pentagon Memorial, attended by family members of victims.\n",

      "Doc:  Kerry tells Israel that Syria accord is no prelude to Iran deal Sunday, September 15, 2013 13:44:54 GMT-05:00 JERUSALEM ‚Äî The U.S. government sought to reassure Israel on Sunday that the U.S.-Russia deal to secure Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons does not diminish American resolve to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. Secretary of State John F. Kerry flew to Israel to personally brief Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on what he called ‚Äúthe most far-reaching chemical weapons removal ever.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs, because that affects all other issues, whether Iran or North Korea or others,‚Äù Kerry said after talks with Netanyahu. President Obama told ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù in an interview broadcast Sunday that Iran understands that its nuclear program is ‚Äúa far larger issue for us‚Äù than the use of chemical weapons in Syria and that the threat a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to Israel ‚Äúis much closer to our core interests.‚Äù He said he was in ‚Äúindirect‚Äù communication with the Iranian leadership. Obama said Iran should not draw the wrong conclusion from his decision to back off from a missile strike against Syria. ‚ÄúMy suspicion is that the Iranians recognize they shouldn‚Äôt draw a lesson that we haven‚Äôt struck [Syria], to think we won‚Äôt strike Iran,‚Äù Obama said. Israel has reacted cautiously to the chemical weapons deal, under which Syria is to sign and ratify the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and submit to inspections and, ultimately, destruction of its weapons. The agreement came after a chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb that U.S. officials have estimated killed 1,400 people. Israel‚Äôs security establishment fears that a failure to punish Syria for its use of chemical weapons could encourage Tehran, Syria‚Äôs ally, to continue to enrich uranium for a bomb. And Israeli diplomats worry that the push for inspections of Syria‚Äôs chemical arms could throw an unwelcome spotlight on the secretive chemical and nuclear arsenal that Israel has built next door. Netanyahu told Kerry that he supports U.S. efforts to force Syria to give up its stockpile of chemical weapons. ‚ÄúThe Syrian regime must be stripped of all its chemical weapons,‚Äù said Netanyahu, standing beside Kerry after their meeting. ‚ÄúThat would make our entire region a lot safer.‚Äù But earlier in the day, Netanyahu sounded a note of skepticism. ‚ÄúWe hope the understandings that have been achieved between the U.S. and Russia regarding Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons will show results, and these understandings will be tested by results ‚Äî the full destruction of the stocks of chemical weapons that the Syrian regime has used against its own people,‚Äù Netanyahu said in remarks to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, when Israel came under surprise attack from Syria and Egypt. ‚ÄúWe must also judge the results of the efforts of the international community to stop Iran‚Äôs nuclear armament,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHere as well, it is not words that will determine the outcome but rather actions and results.‚Äù Kerry heads next to Paris for discussions about the Syria deal with foreign ministers from France, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Netanyahu‚Äôs caution appears to be shared by the Israeli public. In a poll published by the newspaper Israel Hayom, three-quarters of Israeli Jews said they did not believe Syria would give up its chemical weapons ‚Äî and 65 percent said Obama would not succeed in preventing a nuclear Iran. Israel, which is presumed to have nuclear weapons and is suspected of at least some chemical weapons capability, is worried that the Syria deal could reinvigorate calls that the entire Middle East be rid of weapons of mass destruction. That theme is likely to run through much of the discussion of the Syria chemical weapons arrangement during the annual U.N. General Assembly this month. In the past, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons exist as a response to Israel‚Äôs military capabilities.\n",

      "Doc:  Mexico hit again by strengthened Manuel Thursday, September 19, 2013 11:48:00 GMT-05:00 MEXICO CITY ‚Äî Storm-battered Mexico absorbed more damage Thursday from the drenching Pacific system known as Manuel, which inflicted its second strike on the country in less than five days, this time at hurricane strength. Manuel and a system that has swamped Mexico‚Äôs gulf coast, Ingrid, are blamed for at least 97 deaths so far this week and have washed out roads, ruined crops and severed communications in wide swaths of the country. After delivering its first blow as a tropical storm Sunday in southwestern Mexico, Manuel returned to the Pacific and drifted northward, reorganizing and gathering new momentum. It made landfall again Thursday as a Category 1 hurricane and flooded fishing villages along the Sea of Cortez, in the northwestern state of Sinaloa. At least 100,000 people suffered damage to their homes, state authorities said. Mexico‚Äôs hardest-hit region has been the southwestern coastal state of Guerrero, including the resort area of Acapulco, where Manuel‚Äôs landfall Sunday left tens of thousands of tourists stranded and triggered devastating mudslides in nearby communities. The Mexican government has mobilized troops and organized relief flights to Acapulco to deliver supplies and evacuate tourists, but large portions of the city remain flooded, including the airport terminal. Television footage has shown looters ransacking a local Costco and a crocodile thrashing around on one city street. The death toll from the storms is expected to rise as authorities reach remote mountain towns cut off by mudslides. In La Pintada, a village outside Acapulco, at least 58 people remained missing after a hillside collapsed, swamping homes with gushing mud. ‚ÄúIt was as if the mountain exploded,‚Äù said Amelia Salda√±a Gregorio, telling Mexico‚Äôs El Universal that her four children and mother were entombed in the sludge. ‚ÄúIt came crashing down in seconds, carrying away houses and burying others.‚Äù The government has yet to release estimates of the overall damage caused by Manuel and Ingrid, but Treasury officials said they had set aside $1 billion in relief funds. Aerial photos released by federal officials show several roadways and bridges washed out by the storms, including portions of major arteries, such as the ‚ÄúHighway of the Sun‚Äù linking Acapulco to Mexico City. Yet another storm system was brewing Thursday near Mexico‚Äôs Yucatan Peninsula. It would be dubbed ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù if it achieves tropical storm strength.\n",

      "Doc:  Pakistan train derails in bombing, killing at least 7 Monday, October 21, 2013 03:49:00 GMT-05:00 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan ‚Äî A passenger train derailed Monday in Pakistan‚Äôs restive Baluchistan province when a bomb detonated next to it, killing at least seven people, officials said. The Jaffar Express train was traveling from Rawalpindi to Quetta when the attack occurred mid-morning, about 300 miles from its destination. Riaz Ahmed, a railway police officer in Quetta, said the bomb had been planted on the tracks. But Pakistan‚Äôs railway minister, Khwaja Saad Rafiq, told local news media that authorities also are investigating whether a suicide bomber could be to blame. Seven passengers, including three brothers traveling together, were killed, and at least a dozen others were injured, Ahmed said. Four train cars flipped when the bomb detonated, he added. There was no assertion of responsibility for the bombing, but Pakistan‚Äôs military has been battling separatists for years in resource-rich Baluchistan. In 2011, another Quetta-bound train derailed in the southwestern province after a remote-controlled bomb exploded. The Baluch Republic Army, a militant group fighting for secession that has been banned by Pakistan‚Äôs government, asserted responsibility for that blast. At the time, the group vowed that such assaults would continue. But attacks on trains in Pakistan extend beyond Baluchistan, where officials are still trying to recover from a 7.7-magnitude earthquake last month that killed more than 500 people. In August, a bomb detonated on a passenger train in the Punjab province en route from Lahore to Karachi. Three people were killed in that attack. A train heading from Karachi to Peshawar was targeted in a bombing in 2012 that killed two passengers, according to the Express Tribune newspaper. After Monday‚Äôs bombing, train service to and from Quetta was suspended pending a security review, said Ahmed, the railway police officer. ‚ÄúThis was a cowardly attack and an act of terrorism,‚Äù Rafiq, the railway minister, told reporters.\n",
